1
00:00:00,808 --> 00:00:03,003
Yes, I was very popular.

2
00:00:03,688 --> 00:00:05,997
Well, it was a pleasure to me, mister Ferhat.

3
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:10,124
- So to us, at any case.
- Ferhat will accompany you until your car!

4
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,005
Of course.

5
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:15,002
Don't forget: The beginning is the half
business.

6
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,201
The end is the other half.

7
00:00:17,288 --> 00:00:18,004
If you want to kill yourself, do it by living.

8
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:33,004
- And where do you live?
- In an hotel, in cartoon.

9
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:36,605
Hotel Cartoon? Understand.

10
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:40,000
Hotels
ever give a bad feeling.

11
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:43,127
The sorrows and pains of the guests use
to remain in the rooms.

12
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:46,996
- Rent a house.
- Okay.

13
00:00:47,888 --> 00:00:50,004
On the backside of the mosque you will find
"Home Immoveables".

14
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:54,603
Remember me to mister Sadettin. He will
take sorrow for the house.

15
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:59,000
- Thank you very much, why do you do that?
- What?

16
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:04,000
Why do you help us?

17
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:06,999
You has called me and I have come.

18
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:12,204
You will get a cold in this weather.

19
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:16,406
- That's not important. -I have sent
away my driver. I will take a taxi.

20
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,003
I will call for a taxi.

21
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:22,000
Please wait. I will tell you something.

22
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:25,003
I didn't drive by bus since school-time.

23
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,400
You would take a city-bus?

24
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:34,487
Do you see, that you too have influence.

25
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:36,001
I have been changed by you.

26
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:39,204
Nevertheless you should not claim
this too much.

27
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:41,199
Please what?

28
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:43,597
The human being doesn't register
his own life.

29
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:48,000
He has to learn, how to live. See you soon.

30
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:13,407
Hello.

31
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:16,124
What are you doing. Bring the things
downstairs!

32
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:20,406
We have counted the days also.
We will pay you cash...

33
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,206
I don't want it!

34
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:26,122
This debt-story has no end.

35
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,119
We will edit your box also.

36
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,006
- Which box?
- That one with the prayers.

37
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:43,003
The angels came down from heaven, so
pure.

38
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:46,127
- No prayer for the soul. Hymns with
prayers!- That is also beautiful.

39
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,119
I get goose-flesh, Hayri.

40
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,120
Cut off! You are producing boxes
for bitches in order to...

41
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,200
...mix them with my prayer-hymns.
I don't want a box!

42
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:57,121
We of Umut Music will renew the
structures of our company.

43
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,120
If we bring out your prayer-hymns...

44
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,006
...with clarinets and percussion,
there will be created...

45
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:05,804
...an incredible sound.

46
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:07,606
We will make a contract for five years.

47
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,599
Three years are gratis and we will
take over all extras.

48
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,007
That will become a new trend.

49
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,001
What means "Trend"?

50
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:15,121
"Trend" is the name of the mosque
that is built in Taksim.

51
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,006
- I didn't hear anything about it.
- Neither did I. Come uncle!

52
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:20,601
Come you!

53
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:28,002
The angels are descending
gullibly from heaven!

54
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:33,001
Making a chants tape for so cheap?
God will curse us.

55
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:36,999
Sibel, there has been a woman here.

56
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,877
I believe, she wants to invest in our
company.

57
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:43,005
Will we wait a little until we
will drive home? Butler!

58
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:46,999
The wedding will be delayed.

59
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:49,121
It doesn't matter. We can wait...

60
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,006
We have to decide right now.

61
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:56,004
I am pregnant.

62
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:13,000
# I woke up without you this morning

63
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:18,001
# It doesn't work without you

64
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,003
# Even my first cigarette did not taste well

65
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:24,997
# It doesn't work without you

66
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:30,003
# Love is zero-balance

67
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:34,398
# It doesn't work without you

68
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:38,000
# A love, that got balance

69
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:42,005
# It doesn't work without you

70
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:47,001
# I had to ask me again

71
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:51,001
- # Why do I want you so much?
- I love you.

72
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:04,004
# Come, my angel, let me love your nice
face also

73
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:06,806
Silence!

74
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:23,001
What did he do evil to this poor girl!

75
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:27,003
Look at her, how miserable!

76
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:31,000
Son of a bitch!

77
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,999
I call you in order to wish you good
recovery.

78
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,999
If that swine touches you again,

79
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,526
I will kill him!

80
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:23,998
His own mother will not recognise him.
Hello?

81
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:27,718
Thank you very much.

82
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:33,522
Look, the beauty of our shop is
coming again, Hayri.

83
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:37,999
How beautiful. Like a jewel, like flowers!

84
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:40,883
- Hello!
- Hello brother.

85
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:43,761
Where is the fairy queen?

86
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:47,797
Friends, for the hail of our land, our nation
we even owe money to the painters.

87
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:51,005
That all happens, because money is
coming in. We have to find her.

88
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:57,000
Hello. Miss Firuze!

89
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:01,000
Here is Orhan.
We just have spoken of you.

90
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,399
All ready. The shop, we also are shining.

91
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:09,999
Please, one minute.
I will fetch Ferhat. For you!

92
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:16,001
Where? Grand Cevahir, what time?

93
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:22,001
Of course. The song..,

94
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:33,806
Thank you very much.

95
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,801
We will see each other.

96
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:44,205
- Did she make available money?
- That she didn't say.

97
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:46,882
She only told something about heritage
complications.

98
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,118
Oh no! Delay until tomorrow
would be deadly.

99
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,005
No, we have to maintain. Main point
the box will be edited.

100
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:55,003
Oh no, we can't enter the hotel in these
clothes.

101
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:58,798
Let us buy some clothes at Vakko.

102
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:01,197
Wait, not too fast. That is not suitable to us!

103
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:02,880
We don't want to blame our name.

104
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:05,562
The Turkish people are living for
honour and fame.

105
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:06,876
We will find something suitable.

106
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:49,522
By your love I have come into this
miserable situation.

107
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:52,406
I possessed everything except you.

108
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:58,008
# By your love I have come into this
miserable situation

109
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:04,606
# I possessed everything except you

110
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:11,008
# I didn't fear rain and have gone my way

111
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:18,006
# I get goose-flesh by thinking, that you
maybe are not at home

112
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:28,402
# If we would make love, we would
drink until daylight

113
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:35,004
# I wouldn't go to my work and you
wouldn't go home

114
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:48,004
# I get goose-flesh:
what to do, if you will not be at home

115
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:09,003
Impossible, children!
I am always at home.

116
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:12,726
Let us come to the box.

117
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,407
We need good advertising.

118
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:19,206
Posters in all streets. The newspaper
get a whole page with advertising.

119
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:20,607
We could shoot a clip also, couldn't we?

120
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,201
Why not black-white?

121
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,119
The pink at the suit is the first thing, that
gets a colour.

122
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,800
Because of the name "Flower-fields".

123
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:28,397
Children, make a budget for the open air
concertin the stadium.

124
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:34,003
Everything at summer. The concerts in
Aspendos are the most important events.

125
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:37,602
- That is true.
- An excellent idea.

126
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:41,797
Hopefully you don't think: "We have found
a rich chicken in order to pluck.

127
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:45,198
Oh no, how can you think this of us!

128
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:47,199
I have a good feeling for investments.

129
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:49,999
You have inspired me to the
enchanting formula,

130
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:53,161
that opens the gate of my country.

131
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:55,204
I have sought for it several years.

132
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,324
Never could I find the entrance.

133
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,000
What do you say?

134
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,404
You are looking upon a splendid future,

135
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:06,001
but you have to believe on it. Like I do.
- Right!

136
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:12,006
Friends, do you feel arising synergy,
when we are together?

137
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:17,001
Now close your eyes and take the
hands of your neighbours.

138
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,003
Do you feel the force?

139
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:32,601
I do in fact.

140
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:34,997
You see: that is it!

141
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:38,004
Yes, I feel different.

142
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:42,003
- That's it!
- Yes, it has happened.

143
00:11:42,488 --> 00:11:43,807
This is always.

144
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:48,001
I believe, you have found a gold-mine
again, miss Firuze.

145
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:52,125
Now the work is following.

146
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,880
This gentleman is the owner.

147
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:57,199
- He is serving me personally, every time I
come- He is honour and pleasure to me.

148
00:11:57,288 --> 00:12:00,007
- Hello.
- Mr Ferhat,

149
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:04,005
there are important things we have to
talk about. Afterwards?

150
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:20,000
Hello. I am a fan of yours, Angel.

151
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:23,002
You inspired me the charmed words to
open the gate to my real country

152
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:28,000
that I searched for years and couldn't
find the entrance to.

153
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:32,005
I discovered this code with you. If I
lose you, I'll forget it again.

154
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:37,004
I dreamt that you were a sweet little girl
a soft, mellow lover, a warm friend.

155
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,206
I am standing right besides you.

156
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:42,007
A man can only stand behind you.

157
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:44,883
Shadowed by you,

158
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:46,606
under your wide wings.

159
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:49,318
An invisible hand keeps me away.

160
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:52,002
The man you desire does not know
how this feels like.

161
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:54,319
May I be that man?

162
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:58,125
- Kürþat give me that!
- You are hiding a thing.

163
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,847
I am not hiding anything!
Give me that please!

164
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:02,998
What did you do?

165
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:09,000
Maybe all I wanted was

166
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:12,004
to sing a song together.

167
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:14,160
An ordinary, cute song.

168
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:16,003
I wish you could hear it.

169
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,406
Where is Kürþat?

170
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:38,798
To hit a woman?

171
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:42,406
No! I didn't do anything.

172
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:49,002
I will beat the living daylights out of you!

173
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:16,003
Where is the prick of that dog?

174
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:18,999
Sell and give out the money!

175
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:22,127
Damned what will happen to us, you
bastard?

176
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,880
I swear you, I will take revenge.

177
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:26,721
My father is keeping me short.
He doesn't give me money any more.

178
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:27,877
We will cut you

179
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,004
into little slices.

180
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:32,599
Your eyes you son of a bitch,

181
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:35,407
superb ass-hole!

182
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:42,400
You will always remember this view.

183
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:55,603
You have to pay the saxophone-player
and our share on what has been sold

184
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,201
right now-!

185
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:02,205
I am here in order to protect you.
In order to save your life,

186
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:04,199
respecting your father.

187
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:05,801
You are here in Turkey.

188
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:10,200
If you park your car you have to pay

189
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:12,006
in order to prevent damages to your car.

190
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:15,397
Tayyar has to give you some money.

191
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:17,719
We marry you off!

192
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:21,005
Than it will be okay, otherwise!

193
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:24,002
You get addicted in this way!

194
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:29,001
A practical joke! You are to much fan of the
Americans!

195
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:35,001
Help me!

196
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,004
- Have you seen it?
- What than?

197
00:16:57,488 --> 00:17:01,003
- Were not you there?
- No, I haven't seen anything.

198
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:06,004
Please select for me, I have to call that girl!

199
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:20,003
Hello sweetheart, It's me.

200
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:24,205
Are you at home? I will come
and call for you.

201
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:26,999
A concert in Aspendos.

202
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,204
I have enough of the popular press.

203
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:34,997
There is no more privacy! I want to alter just
this,do you understand?

204
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:40,125
I want to share my life and these endless
disruptions only with you.

205
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,403
I love you!

206
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:55,000
Melek, marry me!

207
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:05,727
Why do we stop?

208
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:13,000
I believe, that's your house.

209
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:34,003
- One moment, Ibrahim, what's the matter?
- Hayri, Hayri!

210
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:40,116
- That's our justice.
- Take it easy, time is over.

211
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,996
Do you understand?

212
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:48,597
The weather is beautiful, the field free.

213
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:50,999
The better one should win!

214
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:55,003
Nevertheless you have to suffer a little bit!

215
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:59,197
- For gods sake!
- Come, fair play, fair play!

216
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:03,406
- We have a partner, a sponsor, control it!
- Money is no problem.

217
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:06,524
Your investor is this harmless Ferhat?

218
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:08,997
- Are you responsible for the money?
- Please?

219
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:12,004
- Six millions please.
- What do you mean?

220
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:18,006
Money for two three-million-bullets.

221
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:23,001
- We haven't that much!
- Give him all, what we have!

222
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:27,197
- We have three million.
- Make your heels free.

223
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:30,997
- Please wait still! Oh god!
- Let me speak please!

224
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:35,877
Hello!

225
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:41,127
This is our partner and sponsor,
our soul and everything.

226
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,403
How are you?

227
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:49,127
These bandits assert, that you are their
partner. I don't believe them, but...

228
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:54,521
- It is true. - We have a little problem, that
we probably will solve with you.

229
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:56,007
Which bank?

230
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:59,127
The cash-pay-record-shop,
if you want an other bank...

231
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,996
- Your money will be there tomorrow.
How much? - 88000 in $!

232
00:20:03,488 --> 00:20:06,207
That's too much, what do you think,
mister Orhan?

233
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:10,201
I am your opinion, but mister Ýbrahim has a
different vision.

234
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:13,405
- One half cash, the other one in rates.
- That's convenient!

235
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,000
Tomorrow, but you will be dead,

236
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:22,000
if there is any delay, for what reason ever!

237
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:26,003
Please, that doesn't go!

238
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:29,806
- At ten o'clock.
- Ten!

239
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:33,198
Please close the door behind you.

240
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:38,402
- We will see tomorrow.
- If you permit.

241
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:41,880
- Come now!
- There is nothing wrong?

242
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:45,404
Are you joking?
Please give me my three millions.

243
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:48,999
Thank you!

244
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:52,318
Orhan, take it please! Okay,
now we will go also.

245
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:55,400
- Let us tidy up the papers.
- Okay, later, so I say bye-bye.

246
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:04,401
- Ferhat? Are you well?
- Yes and you?

247
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:07,999
Riddle please, why I have come.

248
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:14,204
- I believe to know it.
- Who is that?

249
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:18,998
- A poster, only for decoration.
- Did you expect me?

250
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:23,005
Yes, I did.

251
00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:29,003
Is this your bed?

252
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,604
- Yes, if you sit down...
- Am I allowed to sit down?

253
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:33,007
Of course.

254
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,007
Come,

255
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,197
I have to say you something but how?

256
00:21:56,088 --> 00:22:03,005
Sometimes there are feelings for
somebody at once...

257
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:10,004
...you know, for somebody, who is totally
foreign. It simply comes.

258
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:14,999
Yes, I understand.

259
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,001
Properly one should say it open-minded,
but it is...

260
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:26,398
difficult to find the right words.
- I agree with you.

261
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:32,999
You...

262
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:38,000
You are a beautiful man.

263
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:44,006
- No, that is only your...
- Wonderful! Great!

264
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:48,801
- You are great also.
- You are like a star.

265
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,603
- Your behaviour should be star-like also!
- All right.

266
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:54,997
- Do trust yourself.
- All right, all right.

267
00:22:56,888 --> 00:22:59,402
You don't think, that I am trying to take profit
of this situation, do you?

268
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:04,999
It is good to be open-minded.

269
00:23:05,888 --> 00:23:08,402
Properly I know very well, what you are
suffering.

270
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:19,205
Let us not play together. I am so confused to
make it short:

271
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:21,006
it has no sense.

272
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,604
Ferhat,

273
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:31,003
I know you have fallen in love with me
totally!

274
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:49,996
# Fifty stars are shining in heaven.
You can see them clearly

275
00:23:50,488 --> 00:23:55,608
# Eyes are treating furtive love

276
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:05,001
# You can read unspoken love in the eyes

277
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:13,006
# A loving bird doesn't know food and water

278
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:23,003
# Could I come together with my
beloved one time a year?

279
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:40,000
There is ever no trace of your partner.

280
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:43,004
What's your
comment upon it?

281
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:45,604
What do you tell me there?

282
00:24:45,688 --> 00:24:47,997
I have said, I can't take profit of the
situation. That's what she has said.

283
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:51,197
What does it mean? Couldn't he say:
come and take profit of me'?

284
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:58,000
No, Tayyar, his boy has received two slaps.
He is crying right at the moment.

285
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:02,596
- Dear Ibrahim.
- What do you say? What?

286
00:25:02,688 --> 00:25:07,000
That lady has opened an account.

287
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:14,798
Of course she has paid on this account.
What else?

288
00:25:15,088 --> 00:25:17,124
- Push play, you bastard!
- Dear Ýbrahim!

289
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:21,121
Let us fix the money. Thereafter we will
speak with Tayyar.

290
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:24,006
We will have an orgy of circumcision or
something like it. Doubtless you will make it.

291
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:28,125
Okay, you still have one hour.

292
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:33,805
If it goes wrong, you know what is
waiting for you!

293
00:25:34,088 --> 00:25:39,116
We will be there soon with the
money-bundles. In which way we will bear them?

294
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:42,006
It's the wrong time for jokes!

295
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:45,999
I would like to withdraw money.

296
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:52,001
Of course, but there is no account
on your name.

297
00:25:52,488 --> 00:25:58,006
Really? Can I speak with the
directress please?

298
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:00,999
We have a director.

299
00:26:06,088 --> 00:26:07,999
Is this the wrong address?

300
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:14,125
Miss Firuze? We don't have this client.

301
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:17,996
I can't remember, we have had her
in former days.

302
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:29,001
# You are like black ribbon, Firuze

303
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:34,000
# In your eyes there is haste

304
00:26:34,888 --> 00:26:37,004
# The years are too slow for you

305
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:44,997
# Why are you in hurry? Wait

306
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:56,397
If your wheel don't have gaps, you are
a newcomer in this profession.

307
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:09,885
Tayyar!

308
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:13,005
How did you discover it?

309
00:27:13,488 --> 00:27:17,003
We will take Tayyar Baba into our club.
Come, my dear, come!

310
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,198
I ask you for advice.
Do you permit?

311
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:23,404
- Do come into the basin!
- I come.

312
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:35,204
Are you able to swim?

313
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:39,122
Are you joking? I have grown up at the
beach of the Black Sea.

314
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,005
We are like this fish.
We have come in order to attack.

315
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:49,116
- Where are the life-belts?
- We have no more of them!

316
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,199
Now. Come to me!

317
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:17,525
- Orhan, Who was this?
- Whom do you mean?

318
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:20,805
- That one, who just past before?
- Tayyar's son.

319
00:28:20,888 --> 00:28:24,005
- What do you say?
- Daddy, the invitations will come today.

320
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:32,116
- You could drown.
- I have a boy with a terrific voice.

321
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:35,120
Could you give us an extra.
For example an...

322
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:38,996
...a party of circumcision or something
like it. -I'll pay the singers.

323
00:28:39,888 --> 00:28:42,197
I found this boy from Germany. You have
token him.

324
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:49,000
Your Melih took my singer, seduced her and
fathered a child with her. Fuck!

325
00:28:52,088 --> 00:28:54,124
Hayri! I come!

326
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:57,996
- He is drowning!
- Good heaven!

327
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:05,000
Orhan, look at him!

328
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:19,606
Everybody is praising your voice.
Let hear it!

329
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:22,998
- I have saved you, Hayri!
- So sing!

330
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:26,004
Sing nightingale, sing!

331
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:32,003
# Your heaven were blue, so blue

332
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:40,004
# The clouds were silver, your hair was
white

333
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:46,127
# There is a rain, so sad and gloomy

334
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:57,005
# When you laugh, tears should flow upon
my hands

335
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:05,004
# A woman, white, quiet and enchanting

336
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:13,004
# A woman, wet, fine and warm

337
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:19,006
# She has to be sorceress of the songs

338
00:30:21,088 --> 00:30:25,001
- Will you marry? - He asked my hand right
at the moment, I wanted to leave him.

339
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:28,999
He says, that he loves me.

340
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:34,000
Forget this person finally!
Advertising, a role in a movie...

341
00:30:35,088 --> 00:30:37,124
You could earn a lot of money.

342
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,119
The Turkish cinema has future.

343
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:42,006
Acting is worse than living with Kürþat!

344
00:30:42,488 --> 00:30:44,604
I hardly can wear the hungry eyes of the
spectators.

345
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:49,798
I cannot endure fashion-shows,
the stage, the camera's!

346
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:53,006
All are looking at me unbrokenly, no!

347
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:04,001
Who is there?

348
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:12,006
I know: the person, who has
written the letter.

349
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:18,006
I haven't read the rest, but it was very fine.

350
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,397
Are you still there?

351
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,999
Please speak!

352
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,003
Properly I would like to get to know you.

353
00:31:35,488 --> 00:31:38,605
What did he say?
How does he know it?

354
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,997
Except Melih the whole world
will know it already.

355
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:49,003
Sweetheart, if we could regulate your
blood-pressure in some way!

356
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:50,999
I never sang pop before, but you know,
I am apt to do it.

357
00:31:51,888 --> 00:31:54,004
Could you talk about it once more?

358
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:03,000
Where is the serum?

359
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,402
Hayri will get work of Tayyar, isn't it?

360
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:09,397
We will get money.
The medicine is sure.

361
00:32:10,088 --> 00:32:13,000
Even with the medicine it will be very
difficult, Seyfi.

362
00:32:14,688 --> 00:32:16,724
Don't you know it? Don't you know the
serious condition of the patient?

363
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:21,006
- You want the baby unconditionally?
- There is nothing, what I could do.

364
00:32:21,888 --> 00:32:25,403
Go out, friends! Don't stress the girl without
necessity.

365
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:34,006
Next week we will shoot Ferhat's clip.
Who is the director?

366
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:37,204
- You!
- My love,

367
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:41,998
if you would be a little healthier, you
could come to the set with me.

368
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:44,406
Everything is black and

369
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:51,201
white until an angel arrives, who brings
a baby with wings.

370
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:54,004
When the baby comes, the clip will
get colours.

371
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:01,999
It is dedicated to you.

372
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:15,004
Sezen Aksu is seeking a soprano.

373
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:17,999
# Let me pass

374
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:21,003
# My pot has been filled by gifts

375
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:23,206
# I know neither sins nor damage

376
00:33:23,288 --> 00:33:26,007
# I am burning of pain

377
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:29,004
# So I have got the pain

378
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:35,008
# What a strange way

379
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:40,006
# Sometimes I lost him, other times
I found him again

380
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:48,003
# I wobbled and didn't move
any more. Let me pass

381
00:33:49,088 --> 00:33:50,999
# Give me my head

382
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,207
# I can't sacrifice myself

383
00:33:54,288 --> 00:33:56,802
# I can't loose myself, can't separate
me of myself

384
00:33:56,888 --> 00:34:00,005
It is the second time, that a haven't got
shampoo in my eyes.

385
00:34:00,488 --> 00:34:03,400
- It will not work.
- I already said, I don't leave my artists.

386
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:07,198
I have been angry with you,
but next time I will bring you out.

387
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:09,324
Don't worry about it!

388
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:11,205
Main point we got the party.

389
00:34:11,288 --> 00:34:14,519
The rest will be easy!
The only thing is, that...

390
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:16,519
We have to organise the fare still.
That is easy.

391
00:34:16,608 --> 00:34:18,758
But Ferhat needs a stage-costume.

392
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:25,196
# Renew my fate, Kahtalým. Do create me
one time more

393
00:34:25,288 --> 00:34:27,324
You king of all barbers. Good morning.
How are you?

394
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:32,000
Also, I am very happy,
I started a new diet and work on a new box.

395
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:36,117
The whole country will speak about it.
Now I am coming out! I am coming!

396
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,996
Come here. Didn't you have a suit for us,
did you? Come!

397
00:34:40,488 --> 00:34:42,319
- Please, stand besides him!
- Why?

398
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:48,002
It will be a little too wide, but it is
the same size.

399
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:51,402
Don't mind. Wide will be in the
fashion this year.

400
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:54,197
Heaven, don't talk such humbug!

401
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:56,518
- Besides: to where do you want to go?
- To my village.

402
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:58,519
No, never. You have a contract!

403
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:01,122
But Hayri Abi didn't want me
at all. Neither did miss Sansar.

404
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:03,119
Accordingly I am displaced here.

405
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:06,006
I have your rights on the box. Look
what has been written!

406
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:11,006
It is valid in the whole galaxy
do you understand, sweety?

407
00:35:13,088 --> 00:35:14,999
Fucked nightingale!

408
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:21,797
But where is the music?
We have fixed everything except the music!

409
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:22,998
Music is everywhere, man!

410
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:27,401
In the bus, in the streets, in the heads
of the people,

411
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:33,997
in shops, restaurants, at brokers,
everywhere!

412
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:36,804
Music is eaten and drunk during
footballgames and elections.

413
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:42,008
One is cursing with music and in this
country no love is swore without music!

414
00:35:42,688 --> 00:35:44,997
- Please drive to the right side. I want
to bale out. - To where?

415
00:35:45,488 --> 00:35:48,719
I have forgotten something in the
hotel. I will return immediately.

416
00:35:48,808 --> 00:35:50,719
Don't come too late, otherwise I will
loose my temper!

417
00:35:50,808 --> 00:35:53,003
All right, I will be there!

418
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:57,205
- Come soon, okay?
- You engage young talents?

419
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,006
For the concert tonight.

420
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:02,397
Am I allowed to recite, please?

421
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:06,398
- He has to, Hayri?
- Do sing, I have said already!

422
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:12,005
# Does love forgive everything thanks
former happy days?

423
00:36:12,888 --> 00:36:16,005
# Does time make forget?

424
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:37,197
- Do you know miss Firuze?
- Yes. She is living in this palace.

425
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:42,400
- She was seeking a room for a girlfriend.
- Where,which palace?

426
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:58,000
- Miss Firuze! I did seek you everywhere...
- Excuse me!

427
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:04,403
I beg you pardon, I mixed up you with
miss Firuze.

428
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:08,000
So the broker and your dress...

429
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:13,001
Please, let us go in.

430
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:16,807
Excuse me please. I just came from Cyprus.

431
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:24,401
- How do you know miss Firuze?
- She is our producer.

432
00:37:25,088 --> 00:37:26,999
What does she produce?

433
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:31,403
We make music and give concerts.

434
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:34,602
So she has changed her profession?

435
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:04,202
Whom do I see there? Welcome.

436
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:10,806
Welcome.

437
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:16,319
Please, miss Firuze, take it easy!

438
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,999
Could I speak with you outside?

439
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,118
I don't understand, why my clothes?

440
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,722
She was healing already.
But than the illness took another way.

441
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,517
- I did not registry it. It went too fast.
- We have to drive away this group!

442
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:35,883
Sorry, but what is the matter with her?

443
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:37,196
Miss Firuze has seen you at T.V.

444
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:39,597
She has thought, you had been fallen in
love with her.

445
00:38:39,688 --> 00:38:41,997
The brain is an enigma.

446
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:47,001
- What does she have?
- Schizophrenia.

447
00:38:47,888 --> 00:38:49,879
What does this mean, schizophrenia?

448
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:53,005
If you are speaking with god, they call it
prayer.

449
00:38:53,888 --> 00:38:58,006
If god is speaking to you,
they call it schizophrenia.

450
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:02,000
If my colleges could hear this!

451
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:07,203
- And the other people? -They are my other
patients therapy for groups!

452
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:09,879
So she doesn't have money?

453
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:12,118
Sir, Firuze has been born in this palace.
She has grown up here.

454
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,880
But how do I have to say?

455
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:16,004
Their parents were assisting miss Süreyya's.

456
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:22,205
- So this place?
- This is her house.

457
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:25,598
She has established the company of
schizophrenia.

458
00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:30,203
- I understand.
- Hello, we telephoned.

459
00:39:30,288 --> 00:39:33,007
It has been paid money on your off shore
account.

460
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:37,197
Mister Ferhat, it is a honour for us, to
receive artists like you in our bank.

461
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:40,402
I have to bring Firuze back to her father.

462
00:39:41,888 --> 00:39:46,882
- Mister Ferhat!- If you permit, I would like
to speak with the gentleman.

463
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:50,005
He has to be confronted with reality!

464
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:19,997
Where is he?

465
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:24,004
What did he say to him?

466
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:28,403
- The truth.
- He has gone thereafter?

467
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:31,999
What is reality?

468
00:40:32,688 --> 00:40:34,997
You have disappointed him.

469
00:40:35,888 --> 00:40:41,008
That was not our aim.
What does rest after saying the truth?

470
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:45,000
If you are real, I am a lie.

471
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:52,397
A paradise without angels!

472
00:41:10,088 --> 00:41:13,125
# The curse of the devil is in the songs

473
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:16,006
# filled by enthousiasm my
situation is serious

474
00:41:16,688 --> 00:41:19,998
# This game is always bad. My dices
always are marked

475
00:41:21,088 --> 00:41:24,000
# It is the endless game, that is
played by fate

476
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:26,999
# If the dices fall in this way

477
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:29,399
# I use to love the beautiful but they
have to be young

478
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:33,000
# The heart is incorrigible

479
00:42:31,888 --> 00:42:34,197
Look at Hoca and Tatu!

480
00:42:34,288 --> 00:42:37,200
They are having fun.

481
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,121
Let them enjoy themselves.

482
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,199
Why did you come here?

483
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:44,199
What did you do?

484
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,880
The ambience is very good. Will I let
dance Halay?

485
00:42:47,088 --> 00:42:51,001
No, wait! Delay what you can.
Go on until they become red.

486
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:10,124
Ferhat, wo do you stay?

487
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:12,403
- All are waiting for you!
- I am no more of the game.

488
00:43:12,888 --> 00:43:15,402
- What does this mean?
- I am not of the game.

489
00:43:15,488 --> 00:43:19,401
- Come and rise!
- No, let me. Why are you here?

490
00:43:22,488 --> 00:43:26,003
Because of this money. If I could
get some of it...

491
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:28,206
I will buy a ticket to my country.

492
00:43:28,288 --> 00:43:31,007
This guy really does want to become slim.

493
00:43:35,088 --> 00:43:36,999
Look at this! All personalities

494
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:39,797
of the world of records and newspapers
have come.

495
00:43:39,888 --> 00:43:42,880
- But where is this little bastard?
- Take it easy and sit down.

496
00:43:42,968 --> 00:43:46,597
This person always has depressions.
What for?

497
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:48,997
As if his beloved has been fucked.
This damned, stupid german!

498
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:52,204
- Go, Ferhat.
- Give up me, Melih!

499
00:43:52,288 --> 00:43:54,404
Why do you give up this dream?

500
00:43:54,888 --> 00:43:57,004
It is because a girl, isn't it?

501
00:43:57,488 --> 00:44:01,197
- Why not?
- I also am in love.

502
00:44:01,288 --> 00:44:03,404
Therefor I can't sing there now.

503
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:06,004
- Who is she, man?
- Melek.

504
00:44:07,088 --> 00:44:08,999
Melek?

505
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:11,999
It is her wedding.

506
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:48,797
- How are you? -You are honouring us.
Thank you very much!

507
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:03,000
Tayyar will kill us. Who is acting
in stead of Ferhat?

508
00:45:07,088 --> 00:45:11,001
No. Studio yes. I am no type for stage.

509
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:21,797
Will we get off with the money?

510
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:26,000
In taht case we are lost...
Who was it?

511
00:45:27,088 --> 00:45:29,807
Go well.

512
00:45:29,888 --> 00:45:34,120
There are no problems, are there?

513
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:39,999
- No problems. Everything goes digitally!
- Flowers!

514
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:46,006
- Look, what I have for you.
- What's that?

515
00:45:46,488 --> 00:45:49,798
My bill. Tayyar gave me the advance.

516
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:53,005
You have to pay the musicians with the rest.

517
00:45:53,808 --> 00:45:56,003
You beggars.

518
00:45:56,688 --> 00:45:58,997
Tayyar will present you an account also.

519
00:45:59,488 --> 00:46:03,800
I didn't want to say it, but the musicians get
their money from another source.

520
00:46:04,088 --> 00:46:07,000
- That's not true!
- It is. I got the rest in cheque.

521
00:46:07,888 --> 00:46:13,804
- Tayyar does understand you.
- Where is the artist?

522
00:46:14,088 --> 00:46:15,407
Without money no artist.

523
00:46:20,688 --> 00:46:22,201
You have to know it.

524
00:46:22,288 --> 00:46:26,998
The son of the "heel-killer" wants to marry
and you leave the wedding-party.

525
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:34,003
Gratulations, you have courage.

526
00:46:35,088 --> 00:46:41,800
- Do you pay at least value added tax?
- Don't worry, we will fix it.

527
00:46:43,088 --> 00:46:45,727
They shoot, if we stay.

528
00:46:45,808 --> 00:46:48,003
But also, if we try to flee.

529
00:46:48,488 --> 00:46:51,002
We have a umbrella inside.

530
00:46:51,888 --> 00:46:53,526
And they have opened it.

531
00:46:53,608 --> 00:46:55,405
The movie has ended. But they don't write
"end".

532
00:46:55,488 --> 00:47:00,198
You have to see it.

533
00:47:00,288 --> 00:47:03,325
- What is the matter?
- What kind of movie?

534
00:47:03,408 --> 00:47:06,002
Ýbrahim und Sansar put the money
in their pocket

535
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:10,003
and didn't pay the orchestra. We are lost.

536
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:24,996
It is all right! An entry at this wedding
wouldn't be suitable to you!

537
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:29,204
It would not be suitable to you also.

538
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:31,999
Fortunately we have no entry!

539
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:38,206
- Do you know, why we are loosing?
- Why?

540
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:41,007
Why we are capitulating always?

541
00:47:41,888 --> 00:47:47,008
Because we always, we always...

542
00:47:47,488 --> 00:47:49,399
- How?
- Why?

543
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:53,000
- We are to honest!
- Humbug!

544
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:55,601
Really.

545
00:47:56,088 --> 00:48:02,004
It is true.

546
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,999
It is softening you up finally.

547
00:48:05,688 --> 00:48:07,997
- I have been softened up.
- Yes, it softens you up.

548
00:48:08,488 --> 00:48:16,998
You have to take it easy sometimes.

549
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:19,999
Cheers? I would kill the person,

550
00:48:20,688 --> 00:48:25,000
who has served me this serum, in the
middle of Taksim-square.

551
00:48:26,088 --> 00:48:29,000
Stop it, Seyfi.

552
00:48:29,088 --> 00:48:32,000
He makes me furious!

553
00:48:37,888 --> 00:48:40,004
Melih,

554
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:46,003
we should let it be.

555
00:48:50,688 --> 00:48:52,007
You are wright.

556
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:58,008
If we are already on our way...

557
00:49:03,088 --> 00:49:08,003
- If we suicide...
- We do it living.

558
00:49:46,088 --> 00:49:47,999
# Forgive me

559
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:56,005
# It is too early for loosing and too late for
loving

560
00:49:57,088 --> 00:49:59,397
# Forgive me

561
00:50:01,088 --> 00:50:02,885
Sir Tayyar

562
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:06,802
Forbidden, I let if forbid in Turkeye and now
he is acting on my party!

563
00:50:06,888 --> 00:50:14,397
# At least your name should remain at the
end of broken things

564
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:19,000
# Pursued by Lonelyness

565
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:23,000
# Forgive me

566
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:30,402
# At time of my love

567
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:36,082
# There still has been rain in this city

568
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:37,999
Kill the bastard!

569
00:50:38,888 --> 00:50:40,401
# Forgive me

570
00:50:43,088 --> 00:50:47,001
# It is too early for loosing

571
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:51,000
# And too late for loving

572
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:55,000
# Forgive me

573
00:50:57,088 --> 00:51:03,004
# At time of my love

574
00:51:03,488 --> 00:51:10,007
# There still has been rain in this city

575
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:19,006
# At time of my love

576
00:51:20,488 --> 00:51:27,007
# Love was as heavy as led in this city

577
00:51:27,488 --> 00:51:30,002
# Forgive me

578
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,999
# The poems of your eyes

579
00:51:33,488 --> 00:51:39,006
# The songs of your hair

580
00:51:40,088 --> 00:51:43,000
Did you really want to kill me or not?

581
00:51:43,488 --> 00:51:47,003
Death is the end of all suffering.
We are on earth in order

582
00:51:47,488 --> 00:51:50,002
to make suffering so that hell can be
unburdened.

583
00:51:50,488 --> 00:51:54,720
- Wag, you are really sensitive!
- Yes very.

584
00:51:54,808 --> 00:51:56,127
That is a part of my profession.

585
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:58,881
Sometimes feelings are stronger than
reason.

586
00:51:58,968 --> 00:52:02,005
Let us make a box for you.
That was only a joke!

587
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:06,000
Here a demo. Listen to it!

588
00:52:08,888 --> 00:52:11,322
- I will apply to you.
- Of course you will.

589
00:52:11,408 --> 00:52:13,797
- Certainly I will apply.
- So do it!

590
00:52:13,888 --> 00:52:18,120
- I did say it, haven't I?
- Yes, you will excuse me now.

591
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:21,996
- What's the matter?
- We will throw out you immediately.

592
00:52:23,888 --> 00:52:25,526
That's how the profession is like.

593
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:27,405
We will break one or two of your
bones also. By tradition.

594
00:52:27,888 --> 00:52:30,004
Do you prefer some of them?

595
00:52:32,088 --> 00:52:37,003
Properly we prefer an existing bone
Orhan, flee!

596
00:52:55,888 --> 00:52:58,004
What do you look? Get them!

597
00:53:03,088 --> 00:53:06,398
# There is no return. I have put fire
to all my ships

598
00:53:06,888 --> 00:53:10,005
# This masked ball with all these false

599
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:14,401
# faces is unbearable to me

600
00:53:18,888 --> 00:53:23,200
One mosque is not enough to you, uncle?
Let us go.

601
00:53:23,288 --> 00:53:24,004
Let us save them.

602
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:27,999
You believe, it is a fire?

603
00:53:31,888 --> 00:53:34,004
Is the basis ready?

604
00:53:34,488 --> 00:53:37,002
All ready, in remembrance to our
common nights.

605
00:53:46,088 --> 00:53:52,004
Wait! Firuze, where are you?

606
00:53:53,088 --> 00:53:56,000
Ferhat has found Firuze.

607
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:28,125
Don't believe, that it is the end.

608
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:30,722
The endless competition never will stop.

609
00:55:30,808 --> 00:55:33,003
They will weep a lot about us and they will
laugh.

610
00:55:33,488 --> 00:55:35,001
Now all together.

611
00:55:36,088 --> 00:55:44,006
# Starving melodies are snaring my heart

612
00:55:45,488 --> 00:55:52,997
# Such a dream, as there were merely songs

613
00:56:26,488 --> 00:56:30,003
# Flying birds seagulls

614
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,002
# A sweet and green springtime

615
00:56:34,088 --> 00:56:39,003
# Laughing and merry love-pairs

616
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:49,004
# Here were sorrows, there desires

617
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:59,006
# Such a sea of loving waves

618
00:58:35,088 --> 00:58:37,602
I have token everything from hospital.

619
00:58:39,088 --> 00:58:40,806
I don't want to come with you now.

620
00:58:40,888 --> 00:58:42,207
Everybody should decide for himself.

621
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:43,880
No, impossible.

622
00:58:43,968 --> 00:58:47,005
We have begun together
and we will end together.

623
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:51,006
It is better, that he doesn't know, that he
has a poor father.

624
00:58:51,888 --> 00:58:53,401
It doesn't mind, that I will not be there.

625
00:58:54,088 --> 00:58:58,001
I am a burden.
He should throw me off.

626
00:59:04,088 --> 00:59:07,603
It is the end for me but I am sorry, that
I have put you with me.

627
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:13,001
That's not necessary! Cheers!

628
00:59:17,088 --> 00:59:21,001
Now the end has come finally.

629
01:01:24,888 --> 01:01:27,004
Sorry, I haven't succeeded.

630
01:01:45,088 --> 01:01:51,004
Sorry, I have a gastric ulcer.

631
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:54,999
They have gone!

632
01:01:58,088 --> 01:02:02,400
- Seyfi?
- Melih!

633
01:02:03,488 --> 01:02:05,001
Ferhat?

634
01:02:06,088 --> 01:02:07,999
- Ferhat, wake up, my boy.
- I beg you!

635
01:02:08,488 --> 01:02:10,399
We are loosing him! Run, keep water.

636
01:02:13,088 --> 01:02:14,999
Please, come!

637
01:02:22,088 --> 01:02:25,000
Ferhat, wake up.
Please, come!

638
01:02:26,088 --> 01:02:30,001
Ferhat, wake up.

639
01:02:44,088 --> 01:02:47,000
- You coward!
- Where is Firuze?

640
01:02:48,088 --> 01:02:52,001
We have been reborn.

641
01:02:53,088 --> 01:02:56,000
Friends, let us start at zero again.

642
01:02:56,488 --> 01:02:58,399
Nobody can halt us.

643
01:02:59,088 --> 01:03:03,001
We will found a new company with
a colourful name.

644
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:08,001
The turn is on us, to serve electric shocks

645
01:03:08,408 --> 01:03:10,205
like the fish under the sand.

646
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:13,446
What was his name?

647
01:03:17,088 --> 01:03:18,999
RA- RAY!

648
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,204
To Hilmi Topaloglu.

649
01:03:23,288 --> 01:03:28,999
Scandal at the wedding!

650
01:03:29,488 --> 01:03:33,197
Their album has been sold 2 million copies.

651
01:03:33,288 --> 01:03:38,203
Turkey is talking about them.

652
01:03:38,288 --> 01:03:42,486
"I was a lighter, I became a director. Now it's
Hollywood!"

653
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:48,200
We all owe it to Firuze.

654
01:03:48,288 --> 01:03:51,997
Melek broke up with her lover.

655
01:03:58,088 --> 01:04:01,000
Firuze still at large.
