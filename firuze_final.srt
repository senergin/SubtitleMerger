1
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:06,197
To my brother Mehmet, who always
wanted me to shoot a Turkish film.

2
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:10,404
Groaning melodies entered into my soul.

3
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:14,196
Such a dream is a place of eternal songs.

4
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:19,200
Singers and
loving people everywhere.

5
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:23,204
The music world is like
dreams, like an own world.

6
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:28,399
Everybody wants to become a singer, wants
to get famous and honoured, but...

7
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:32,799
...all people are waiting for agenerous
stranger, for a saving angel, who...

8
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:35,401
...is taking them by hand.

9
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:37,205
They are waiting for us.

10
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:41,078
Hear, the time has come.

11
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,204
As there are policemen in civil...

12
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:49,203
...there are angels in civil, who are
living here.

13
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:51,406
this film was inspired by true stories

14
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:55,400
They have composed songs, even
have asked for help.

15
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:59,400
A visit without invitation is not
suitable for the race...

16
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:02,081
of angels that much caprice is necessary.

17
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:07,596
Properly everything there
is like a movie.

18
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:10,680
If you are open for such things, it will be
impossible to you...

19
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:12,280
...to distinguish reality of movie...

20
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,198
It is like a tale.

21
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:20,205
Everywhere evil wolfs are leering.

22
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,801
Well, there is Seyfi...

23
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:31,199
...he is the leader of the group. He is an
artist, who knows his profession:

24
00:01:31,887 --> 00:01:35,402
The first setting of the movie is the most
important one.

25
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:39,196
If this is correct your spectator will be
bound.

26
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:43,043
His glance will be tied
like the eyes of a duck

27
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:45,197
...that is looking at a fish.

28
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:49,198
Like a confused duck.

29
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:55,205
The main point of shooting
is the position of the camera.

30
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:06,203
Give it to me! Hurry up, we want to
record right now.

31
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:10,204
Move don't look like fishes, who have
seen a duck! Music!

32
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:13,321
What kind of music? Do you have
something to do with music?

33
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:16,205
I was a fan of Elvis.

34
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:23,401
In former days I listened to jazz.
When I was in love...

35
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:25,318
...I liked Arabic music and than rock.

36
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:27,204
I prefer arrangements, like flowers.

37
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:32,199
Now treason and injustice reign the
music world.

38
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:36,084
Good people exist only in tales.

39
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:39,603
An example: love had robbed all reason
of Melih...

40
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,806
...a promising young singer.

41
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,605
He also was one of these people...

42
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:51,078
...who would sacrifice
everything for love.

43
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,198
Who is left will be my haul.

44
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:57,521
Where is my red-brown crane?

45
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:00,203
Why didn't you get changed?

46
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:03,519
I will not act. I have come in order to collect
my luggage.

47
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:07,077
Where to? With this guy?

48
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,317
Didn't I say you, that he is not allowed to
show himself at this place?

49
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,635
Get away you!

50
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:12,797
That's the reason, that he is waiting outside.

51
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:14,798
Tayyar, I have to get money still!

52
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:21,205
First the scene, than the money!
Where can I find a singer still?

53
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,803
I am pregnant. I need the money.

54
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:28,197
What, you are pregnant?

55
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:35,805
No stage to ya no more Melih! You'll
sing in bath houses only!

56
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:38,321
Don't cry so loudly! You don't know
anything!

57
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:40,204
Give me the money, you arse-hole!

58
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:54,205
You can't call a Lacen an arse-hole

59
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:59,802
without loosing your life...

60
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:03,003
Why without consequences?

61
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:06,199
The angels are surrounding her but

62
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:10,003
sometimes unexpected things happen.

63
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:13,204
Suddenly all doors had been closed to them.
They didn't see any exit.

64
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,204
An awkward love-fairy

65
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,998
There was this nice saying

66
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:24,326
played a bad game with these lost souls.

67
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:27,205
They all fall together, if one of
them is falling.

68
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:30,599
We couldn't permit it.

69
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:34,596
Did somebody make promises?

70
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:39,326
The financial decisions have been
made at the last meeting.

71
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:43,195
- That's not important.
- With whom has been arranged this?

72
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:46,082
Mister Orhan,

73
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:51,403
a genius in financing. Specialist for legal
contracts.

74
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:57,198
He has succeeded to make a warm
refuge of a tiny hotel-room.

75
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:02,080
One is appealing for prayer. Please get up!

76
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:06,206
The prayer, Orhan Abi!

77
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:20,038
Hoca would like it to have a talk with
you. The debts are towering up.

78
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:22,322
He is downstairs and seems to
be very upset.

79
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:27,197
Okay, therefore I have woken up early.
After the prayer I wanted...

80
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:48,797
You didn't still sign a contract, did you?

81
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:54,200
He have made an usual agreement
with the producer.

82
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:58,596
Hayri Bey is a remarkable head.

83
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:02,199
He is really charismatic.

84
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:05,326
He is worried about his artists

85
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,602
like a protecting fairy.

86
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:10,403
They will come soon.

87
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:13,206
Oh god, let it go well!

88
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:18,404
Stop it, so early in the morning!

89
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:20,205
Let me go to the W.C, you son of a bitch!

90
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:30,996
It is not easy, to produce music.

91
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:35,797
Mister Hayri feels a peculiar pleasure
at the meal of the wolfs.

92
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,202
They find a diamant in the mud.

93
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:47,197
His career has begun in Europe.
He advanced quickly.

94
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:49,200
Now we are at Love!

95
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:53,202
Sure, a honourable boy, but a certain
distance is necessary.

96
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:56,198
A real cuddle-cat!

97
00:06:57,287 --> 00:07:00,199
Come and applaud also!

98
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:08,197
Enough! Pigs!

99
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:14,198
St, the boss is calling!

100
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:19,200
You are terrific, applaud with us!

101
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,196
- Hello, I am Sansar.
- I know you.

102
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:29,996
Tonight there will be a Turkish night in
Munich.

103
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:33,397
I would like to be the star on the stage
in stead of Erdil.

104
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,603
- Don't you havea manager?
- No.

105
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:37,805
Such a coincidence!

106
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:41,800
You have to sign here! In Germany
nothing works without contract.

107
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:54,201
Whom do I see?

108
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,603
Coming all the way to here!

109
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:03,403
- He is it!- Friends, we have to interrupt
the meeting. There is a visitor.

110
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:06,196
Welcome.

111
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:17,405
Please be quite, madam Firuze.

112
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,398
Excuse me, can we have a talk outside?

113
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,205
This person is seeking me everywhere!

114
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,601
# Stay, where you are

115
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,203
# Don't make me crazy

116
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:55,087
# I haven't to pay a bill

117
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,796
# neither have I to go to confession

118
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,359
# I don't see my left hand, not my right hand

119
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:19,598
# I can't separate friends of enemies

120
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:23,680
# I don't know myself anymore.
I capitulate and stop the game

121
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:26,406
- How are you, Hayri?
- Wow! Is there somebody at the door?

122
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:28,205
See you!

123
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:42,204
You damned... That's my house.

124
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,198
You can't exchange the lock!

125
00:09:46,087 --> 00:10:00,206
Asshole!

126
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:02,198
Please, open the door.

127
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:09,806
- Otherwise I will break it open!
- Shut up!

128
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:13,199
Don't shout! Open that damned door!

129
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:16,315
I only want to Change my clothes and
will go again immediately.

130
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,477
Show me the children!

131
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,320
You have forgotten, how our children
look like.

132
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:24,797
- I am getting crazy! That's my house!
- The bum of that bitch is your home.

133
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:28,323
Your companions are not able also to
maintain their wives.

134
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:30,398
I look after the woman here.

135
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:33,399
I will say to Seyfi, that he has to pick up me.

136
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:39,201
We have discovered a new voice.
The boy is great.

137
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,200
A voice like candy. The new Pavarotti.

138
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:45,202
We will make studio-sessions today.
Not with the same clothes.

139
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:51,200
Neval, I will dedicate you the album.

140
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:02,199
- Piss off!
- What is the matter, Neval?

141
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:26,207
- Hamit!
- Good morning.

142
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,999
- How are you, my love?
- Good, but I hardly can hear you.

143
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:34,599
- Take off your headphones!
- I don't hear anything.

144
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:42,405
Regard this face, this attitude. The people
will close him in their hearts.

145
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:44,603
The people will close me in their hearts.

146
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,597
- Hopefully everything is going well today.
- Thanks.

147
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:54,402
- I would wish, that you will stay modest
always. Okay? -I will not Change.

148
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:57,081
- No, not at all. What's the matter with
the basis? -Everything is clear:

149
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,806
the violins and the percussion. -Did
the scoundrels play well? -Excellent!

150
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:03,197
Come with us. Welcome on the market
of records, Hamit.

151
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:34,199
Look around very well.
Here is the real battle-field.

152
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,203
If you enter here by foot, your heart
will beat wildly.

153
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:41,802
- What is that? - A pump.
- A natural injection.

154
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:45,402
- A natural injection-pump. -That's why you
have to appear here with a safe tank

155
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:48,206
so that the rifles of the infantry immediately.

156
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:52,404
Hayri, do you know, which datum we have?

157
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:55,797
- You have to talk with him.
- But he is totally silly already.

158
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:11,325
- What do you drink?
- Medicine for nightingales.

159
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:17,357
- What is this supposed to be?
- It makes singing every silent nightingale.

160
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:21,201
Hayri wants studio-fee.
I hardly could Change his mind.

161
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:24,203
- Let's work now.
- Thanks.

162
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,200
Music.

163
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:37,206
The tape has a rotation-problem. It is turning
round too quickly.

164
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:40,200
- No, Ahmet Bey did want this way.
- Who is Ahmet Bey?

165
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,596
And we have been in accordance of his
wishes. Several times we have said to him.

166
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:48,405
- One moment, dear Ahmet.
- Yes, please?

167
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:53,402
You know, that the record has cost the
whole money. The musicians have arrived.

168
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:57,196
The pit is in a way too sharp.
How do you mean being able to sing this?

169
00:13:57,527 --> 00:14:01,202
- I have prepared explicitly B-flat. I am tenor.
- What?

170
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:05,359
B- flat.

171
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:09,201
Hayri, I am the king.

172
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:13,196
Well, we will see!

173
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,197
You and B-flat, you fucked nightingale!

174
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:08,201
The A is better for you.

175
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:22,318
- We have to edit it.
- Go away with lukewarm water.

176
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:26,195
No, I mean the cassette tape. But how
and with whom?

177
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:29,997
- We have to find somebody, Hayri?
- What?

178
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:31,805
So we went to bottom totally.

179
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:38,205
- Is not there a fish, that is living at the bottom? What is his name?
- How can I know it?

180
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,316
Such a flat one with prickles on his tail.

181
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:48,198
I know, that poisonous one.
He serves electric shocks. We are like them.

182
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:51,202
We are laying in the sand and waiting
noiseless.

183
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:55,202
Suddenly we attack.

184
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:59,201
No, we don't want to get a shock.

185
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:03,805
Look, if the tape of Ýbrahim Tatlýses doesn't
arrive, could...

186
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:06,799
...you give him back the box and
request your money?

187
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:09,321
We are not able to sell it. We are
still sitting on it.

188
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:15,039
Friends, the music-family of Umut remotes the
word repayment out of his vocabulary right now.

189
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:18,324
- Our possibilities for retaking are tired out.
- What does it mean?

190
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:24,403
It is limited at 30%, but we haven't even
made al 50% of the music-box.

191
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:26,205
Go, my friend!

192
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:33,006
Go, my friend.

193
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:42,197
Ýbrahim's bull!
That's the matter, master?

194
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:50,200
Who is coming there? Welcome, my dear!

195
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:54,359
I just have said to the boys,

196
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:58,804
that Ibrahim is looking like Elvis very
much! Haven't I, Orhan? -Yes, you have.

197
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:04,200
Orhan, my dear, you have sold the not
existing tape except to me to otherpeople.

198
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:09,205
Orhan, coffee. That are all rumours!

199
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:13,359
You are our marketing man.

200
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:18,202
Oh no! How do you want to pay?

201
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:24,361
Well, this new boy, what was his name? He
is tenor, singing B-flat, believe me!

202
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:29,077
What does B-flat mean? Could you sell
his last tape?

203
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:31,397
Not at all! Nothing happened.

204
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:35,799
We have made 15000 records of his last
box but we had to retake 25000.

205
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,606
Even the boxes of the black market had
been burdened to us.

206
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:47,202
Tayyar, my sir, we just have
spoken about you.

207
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,199
Twenty days?

208
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:56,599
That never will be sufficient! Say it to me, if I
make a mistake.

209
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:05,200
Your debts amount to 88.000 $

210
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:11,077
I beg you, say at least twenty days!

211
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,317
Say it to me, if I make a mistake.

212
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:14,806
What will we do, Hayri?

213
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:20,200
We will go to sleep three times and will
wake up three times.

214
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:25,203
After three days we will get our
money or not?

215
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:37,196
What will be now? Boxes mean money.

216
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:40,201
We let sing somebody, but whom?

217
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:44,596
Well, I get a little bit money...

218
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:52,197
...of the last box. I have thought: if it is
convenient now...

219
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:54,206
Hayri?

220
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,206
Orhan?

221
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:10,084
Why do you laugh?

222
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,806
You have broken the nose of
a new singer!

223
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:17,597
- No, I don't have people for you.
- This Sansar was not able to sing the song.

224
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:22,200
One can't beat up all people
who are not able to sing.

225
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:30,200
In short time you would have a
slaughterhouse.

226
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,364
Honoured audience, the unique national
634th competition...

227
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:41,202
...for the golden dream presents participant
number 42: Semra Comez!

228
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:55,918
- We have no other merchandise for you.
- Sansar,

229
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:58,077
we want this boy from Germany.

230
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:02,319
No, if I bring him here, he may have
money...

231
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:05,365
...that will land in your pocket.

232
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:08,359
You will produce
the box for good money...

233
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:10,642
...and my fee will be a watch.

234
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:13,195
No, my love, I can't do anything for you.

235
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,324
Ferhat, that you had to call me.

236
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:27,319
I was not present just at the moment, you
wanted to telephone me.

237
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:30,080
Something is wrong with the international
connections. I could not reach you.

238
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:32,198
How is the weather in Germany?

239
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:37,205
Well, my friends tell me that I look very
well, but you might have your own opinion.

240
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:42,402
Please? No, my eyebrows did not grow
together...

241
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:44,523
...but if you want, I can let them grow.

242
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:46,086
That's what they do themselves already.

243
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,324
Therefor I meant... rap, pop, jazz, I could
sing everything.

244
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:53,195
Ferhat, sing something!
In B-flat please!

245
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:58,199
That's a serious supply for a box, isn't it?

246
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:18,200
# I am a male old maid

247
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:23,200
# There is no wife for
lazy-bones

248
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:27,197
# What can we make still?

249
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:32,196
# I am not able to rob a bank

250
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:36,324
# In that way I have come to love

251
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:38,318
# My love is totally different

252
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:42,195
# I have seen so many beautiful girls.
The whole day

253
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:51,360
# Men do suffer also and not so little

254
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:56,202
# but this is no solution. Only the matrimony
gives purification

255
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:20,200
Ýbrahim, my record-master has to come and
edit my box...

256
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,201
...otherwise I will suicide.

257
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:29,600
Make for me a box! Than I will
become famous.

258
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:40,315
Hear, daddy, let me explain. Please, let me
explain it.

259
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:42,602
Tayyar sends you his greetings.

260
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:49,196
Stop! Nothing may be wrong left or right?

261
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:55,202
Where is Umut-music, please?

262
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:58,200
Left.

263
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:02,201
Oh, my god! They kill!
Allah, Allah!

264
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:09,324
- Master, they have killed somebody inside.
- All life will be taste dead. - What?

265
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:12,319
- They have shot Ibrahim!
- Salvation to your soul, Ýbrahim!

266
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:16,195
- They have hit his heel only! -Could you
save your life again, you dirty swine!

267
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:19,999
- Where is Umut-music?
- Look over there.

268
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:24,205
But in reality there is no hope and no music.

269
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:26,918
If you can wait, you may meet her.

270
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:31,398
I repeat, we will pay. Orhan, do something!

271
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:34,320
I can't do anything, I am standing
between two liquidations.

272
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:39,197
Hayri, let it be! Let it be their blame!
Forget it!

273
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:45,202
Let me the little T.V. please. Tomorrow
comes an international game. Osman!

274
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:50,006
You are on my black list, because you
have done this to me.

275
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,601
Cancel that list, man!
Rather pay your debts.

276
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:56,324
- Hayri!
- Good recovery, my dear Ibrahim!

277
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:58,318
- Hayri!
- That has nothing to do with us.

278
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:00,204
You have still two days, do you understand?

279
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:04,199
I am lost. They take even the fax.

280
00:24:04,687 --> 00:24:08,362
Please not! Be pity!

281
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:12,201
Please not! Not the fax!

282
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:18,203
You can take evrything, everything!

283
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:29,203
They will kill me,if they discover, that I have
bought it in a second hand shop.

284
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:36,323
How much did you pay for it, my little boy?

285
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,716
What kind of money? I have paid with
natural products.

286
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:40,001
Three parcels with dance-music!

287
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:43,318
Your name should be engraved in the
monument for the resurrected people.

288
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:45,318
Your are such a fox!

289
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:47,921
What do you say? The inner of the
TV was empty.

290
00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:50,123
I have put a sewing-machine in it in order to
make it heavier.

291
00:24:50,207 --> 00:24:54,200
- Really?
- Pardon, who is Mister Hayri?

292
00:24:54,687 --> 00:24:57,997
- He has died, I regret.
- How?

293
00:24:58,087 --> 00:24:59,884
- His mortal remains are
washed. - Has he died? - Yes.

294
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,320
What do you say there? It is for him, that
I have made such a long voyage.

295
00:25:01,407 --> 00:25:04,319
- Who is seeking him?
- Ferhat Can from Germany.

296
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:07,399
My hero, dear brother, Hayri!

297
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:12,321
Welcome, you well-looking star.

298
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:15,205
Let us beat the record at the record-market.
Orhan,

299
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:17,324
call for the notary in order to make a
protocol.

300
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:19,318
A record in short time producing of
music-boxes!

301
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:21,921
Orhan, call now for the studio in
order to record.

302
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:24,316
Not now, it is closed. To-morrow.

303
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,318
OK, OK, to-morrow.

304
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:29,319
So you have time for learning the songs.
Everything here in Istanbul goes fast.

305
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:33,320
- There is my partner Orhan.
Where is Seyfi? - Hello!

306
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:37,195
Clip PR-leader Seyfi. You know already
our star Melih.

307
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:42,326
Well, that TV...

308
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,319
Do make something. Well, we were busy,
we wanted to renew the decorations...

309
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:48,080
...and than you came. Excuse me for the
disorder.

310
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:50,078
Come to here. This here and this.

311
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,203
- Is it ready?
- Yes, ready. That is it!

312
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:02,406
What kind of market is this? I thought,
you were dead.

313
00:26:02,487 --> 00:26:05,399
God save us! He might give us all a long life.

314
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:08,320
Ferhat there is this fish, that is hiding
under the sand.

315
00:26:08,407 --> 00:26:10,318
If you step on him he offers you an
electric shock.

316
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:12,318
That's what I want to ask you the whole
time, but I am forgetting it ever.

317
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:15,319
We are exactly like this fisch.
We will strike, Melih.

318
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,319
Bring him to Kahtalý in order to tidy up.

319
00:26:18,407 --> 00:26:19,920
With this hair he has no chance.
Let us cut it.

320
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:22,805
This boy will become very famous.
We will strike.

321
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,006
It will come a day, that we enter this hotel
with pride and high breast.

322
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:18,203
That is it! Tatu Head&Leg is
presenting proudly.

323
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,197
- Do you need something more?
- Bring another bottle. Will we drink it?

324
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:26,196
Delicious. I haven't eaten it since
three months.

325
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:43,201
- Orhan, what did we properly sign today?
- A contract.

326
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,324
Sansar let me sign something also.

327
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:49,204
Let me see!

328
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:51,325
Miss Sansar is really okay.

329
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:56,197
We make charges and PR and she gets
the whipped cream.

330
00:27:56,887 --> 00:28:01,199
It does go like that! Here is a paragraph, that
binds you ten years at us.

331
00:28:02,887 --> 00:28:05,196
- What, ten years?
- Well, than good luck!

332
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:20,204
What do you think?

333
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:25,606
Last five years I am not able to think of other
things than of music.

334
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:30,005
Sometimes your look is darkling.

335
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:31,918
Nevertheless you are going on. Than you
look back and you see,

336
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:35,204
that you are at the same place.
You are not there.

337
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:43,920
- Hopefully this room will bring you
good luck. - Hopefully.

338
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:49,315
It didn't bring me luck, but I am content,
when I am in love.

339
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:52,205
We are artists. We are living of air and love.

340
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:56,196
I repeat it many times. This boy is so
sensitive.

341
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:01,038
I beg you pardon, my nerves!

342
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:03,687
- Because you have said...
- Boy to a full-grown man.

343
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:06,327
- What is the connection with your baby?
- High blood pressure.

344
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:09,205
It would be better, if she doesn't
get her baby.

345
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:12,999
The results of the medical
examination are bad.

346
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:25,202
That is the revenge of the sensitive people.
We are lost.

347
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:31,085
Does somebody come with me
into the night-bar?

348
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:36,200
# There is no kind of sorrows, that I don't
know, that I didn't suffer

349
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:42,202
# No day, no night without grief

350
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:45,403
After the black-out of current he jumped
to the stage.

351
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:51,205
He has a good voice but no reason. Right
away he has contacted Tayyar.

352
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:55,006
- Who is Tayyar?
- Come, my egg, please come!

353
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:57,323
Hayri, you have brought bad
luck to this girl!

354
00:29:57,407 --> 00:29:59,523
The one, who let shoot in the foot of
Ýbrahim, is Tayyar

355
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:02,599
- Why did he do it?
- Main point is...

356
00:30:02,687 --> 00:30:04,200
...the length of the prick, do you understand?

357
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:13,326
We have found a job at Kumkapý.
Tayyar has forbidden Melih, to go on stage.

358
00:30:13,407 --> 00:30:16,001
He let shoot in the leg of the operator
of the club.

359
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:18,317
But why got Melih upset?

360
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:20,398
Tayyar has fallen in love with Melih's girl.

361
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,398
That the reason, why his behaviour is gentle.

362
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,206
# There is no trace of my old ego

363
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:31,600
# I am tired of the pains

364
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:38,207
# Please support my arms.
Otherwise I will fall down

365
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:44,202
# I am so lonesome and lonely

366
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:50,203
# I am so lonesome and lonely

367
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:08,597
Why don't you tell this guy, that you are
pregnant?

368
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:16,000
He doesn't know, if he will marry me.
There is still time.

369
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:18,601
What ever will happen, I will give
birth to this baby.

370
00:31:18,687 --> 00:31:22,202
First time of my life I am doing
something useful.

371
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:26,404
Let us say, that we tolerate these men
because of their victorious future.

372
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:29,047
If their luck has turned and the money is
flowing...

373
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:30,799
...they will leave us.

374
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:35,360
The truth is, girls, that there are only roles
for men in this picture.

375
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:37,563
What will happen with us?

376
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:42,199
My dear god, why did you create these
women?

377
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:58,404
# I don't like it any more

378
00:31:58,487 --> 00:32:02,196
# To be playthings!

379
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:19,404
# Am I a slave?

380
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:23,082
# So delivered I am tired of life

381
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:26,204
# She can go, if she doesn't need
me any more

382
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:33,204
# Give me patience...

383
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:41,205
Here is the real battle-field.

384
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:44,196
We will win.

385
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:48,197
Kahtalý! We will record.

386
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:52,800
He is really a nighintale.

387
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:18,923
My hero, my best one!

388
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:21,801
Did I succeed?

389
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:27,202
- Do I have a box also?
- Come and let me kiss you! Well made!

390
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:29,316
What have I said you?

391
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,195
This boy will belong to the very grand
people, I promise.

392
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:38,596
What is the matter here?

393
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:42,363
We have discovered him and you will pick
him up! No sir!

394
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:44,722
Didn't you want to come to me directly
after your arrival?

395
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:46,001
Don't exaggerate it, Sansar!

396
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:48,078
The last one, you have served us, was suited
to nothing. Thereafter we took that one.

397
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:52,206
To where, what is the matter? No, there is
nothing, to where do you go?

398
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:55,003
One minute.

399
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:58,324
Here is a copy of the contract and
what do we read?

400
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:02,195
Ferhat Can, living at Berlin,

401
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,801
Neuköllnstr. 62.

402
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:07,401
Bravo, you gained the rights.

403
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:10,206
The German judges will worry about them.

404
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:13,401
Well, perhaps it will make sense,
if you ask my advice...

405
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:15,603
...before making the next contract, Sansar.

406
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:20,405
This here has not ended!
There comes an aftermath.

407
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:22,398
Sansar, will never forget this.

408
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:24,603
She will not forget it! She is an elephant.

409
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:32,325
What, twenty?

410
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:35,604
In spite of your debts I have to spend
my own money for...

411
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:40,203
...t Do you have more wishes? s?

412
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:43,996
You have to trust me, Osman!

413
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:46,317
You know, my name means confidence.

414
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:48,363
What kind of confidence?

415
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:51,200
The loss of your TV by decision
of the court?

416
00:34:52,287 --> 00:34:56,599
Japanese technology is great.

417
00:34:57,287 --> 00:35:01,360
Look, the new mobile phone is...

418
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:04,803
...a flat-iron at the same time.
- Really?

419
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:06,206
We will buy it for your wife.

420
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:17,204
# Don't trust him with your love

421
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:21,202
# He will transform your tears to ferocious
streams

422
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:26,203
# Thanks to men your laughing will become
weeping

423
00:35:26,687 --> 00:35:30,202
# Don't be deceived by him, don't
believe him

424
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:35,203
# He will leave you and will
speak about you

425
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:38,075
# He will leave you and will speak
about you

426
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:40,198
Stop it!

427
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:43,198
The face of the black man is too dark!

428
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:46,040
Good! But what will we do?

429
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:48,402
With more light she will look shabby,
with less light...

430
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:52,082
...the black dancer will be in darkness.
What can we do?

431
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,397
How do the Americans succeed?

432
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:57,001
They have black, red, white and mixed
people?

433
00:35:57,087 --> 00:36:00,204
The Americans do know their business.

434
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:06,599
So Tanju Gürsoy doesn't want to
participate on our program.

435
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:10,397
You don't still have the demo of that boy.

436
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:15,197
He also looks very well. Could you
take charge of him?

437
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:53,599
I will give birth to this child, whatever it will
cost me.

438
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:57,206
You will guard me and my child.

439
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,405
Muammer!

440
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,318
What the hell is this?

441
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:09,195
Sterling from North-Africa!

442
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:12,401
In which pocket can I put this stuff?

443
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:15,320
It has been written in the contract, that the
rent is paid in foreign currency.

444
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:17,079
Well, that is exactly what we are doing.

445
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,921
In the exchange office they have regarded the card,
but didn't even find the name of the country, my child.

446
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:23,084
Surely it was an obsolete card.

447
00:37:23,287 --> 00:37:25,323
Now they have new ones, after civil war...

448
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:27,477
...many people have died. Didn't you
hear about it?

449
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:29,080
They have gold-leads.

450
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:32,398
Look, the nephew of this king has given
us the money personally.

451
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:36,321
We make a box for his nephew. Heaven,
what a voice!

452
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:38,602
- A nightingale!
- Heaven, we will become rich.

453
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:45,081
I have enough of you. You have to leave
this shop immediately, understood?

454
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:49,925
Run!

455
00:37:50,287 --> 00:37:53,085
If we don't organise money for the...

456
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:55,596
...advertisements of the box, we will be lost.

457
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:58,201
Do you call it black money?

458
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:02,596
# My breath suffices to say it

459
00:38:02,687 --> 00:38:05,406
# but what, if you don't listen to me?

460
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:08,399
# I have come in order to proceed
through the sea of love

461
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:11,206
# and to plunge into your ocean

462
00:38:17,887 --> 00:38:21,402
# I am the better creature of god

463
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:25,196
# have no bad veins

464
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:32,324
# I am the nightingale of these company

465
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:40,200
# I have come to you in order to sing for you

466
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:46,600
# My deficit is my kernel

467
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:51,205
# I have come for living in your home

468
00:38:54,687 --> 00:38:59,203
Hayri! Osman didn't make the boxes!Shit!

469
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:03,202
Osman, you breach of promise!

470
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:06,201
I will kill you! Go away!

471
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:11,200
Hayri, I beg you, stop it!

472
00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:15,599
You got that much money. Don't you
have any conscience?

473
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,726
I beg you pardon, take it as repayment
of your former debts.

474
00:39:18,807 --> 00:39:20,718
Without a brother like you I would do
much better!

475
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:23,321
And you, brother? Because of you
I was even in prison!

476
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:26,319
Only one week! There are people who
use to die for their brothers.

477
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:29,319
You kill your brother with your own hands!

478
00:39:29,407 --> 00:39:32,205
- If mother would be still alive, she would
spit you in your face! -Mama!

479
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:44,085
- What do you say there, are you crazy?
- Let the family out of game.

480
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:46,317
You have blamed us enough already.

481
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:48,318
Gods punishment will strike you!

482
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:50,716
- Damned the day, where on I became your
brother! -It is you, who should be damned!

483
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:54,197
- I said it first! - Damned!
- I took green.

484
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:03,323
- 572 €
- Is the plot inclusive?

485
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:05,318
I am so sorry, but

486
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:07,682
the medicines from Germany are
transported in...

487
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:09,200
...little condensers. Therefore they are a
little bit expensive!

488
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:14,199
I have to stay culpable for the half.

489
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,198
How much is an €, most honoured man?

490
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:31,199
I say hello!

491
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:40,200
- Looks great!
- Money!

492
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:43,196
Look at him!

493
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:49,798
"Nice clothes. Take them off. Come with
me to my home".

494
00:40:53,687 --> 00:40:56,804
- Hayri!
- Already one time more! Come separate!

495
00:40:58,887 --> 00:41:01,799
We have been saved!

496
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:04,321
Didn't I say you, that I will take revenge for
you and Neval.

497
00:41:04,407 --> 00:41:06,318
This day has come.

498
00:41:06,407 --> 00:41:11,322
- What do you say there?
- Didn't Tanju Gürsoy cancel?

499
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:13,602
Therefore they bring out young talents.

500
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:16,406
I have given the demo to the
stage-assistent.

501
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:19,047
I have said, that he possesses
evening-clothes also.

502
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:22,403
Well. But Osman didn't make the boxes

503
00:41:22,487 --> 00:41:25,206
if Ýbrahim hears it, he will make us to
ground meat!

504
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:30,316
If Ferhat wins the friendship of
Ýbrahim at TV?

505
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:33,319
If he says, that he has supported him?

506
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,319
In that case we will be saved?

507
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:40,002
Promotion, TV, I got you, Ýbrahim!

508
00:41:44,287 --> 00:41:46,323
- Come, go now! When is the broadcasting?
- It is urgent, immediately!

509
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:48,318
Do you have your clothes with you?

510
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:50,716
- Well, I used the money of the
advertisements for... - OK, Melih,

511
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:52,081
go quickly to the hotel and take it.

512
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:56,201
Well Orhan, let us tell it Ýbrahim

513
00:41:58,287 --> 00:42:04,203
"Nice clothes. Take them off. Baby,
come with me to my home. "

514
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:24,923
Hear, give me the key of Ferhat's
hotelroom!

515
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:26,998
I really thought, it was the old uncle,

516
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:32,320
Isn't that Ferhat's stage-costume,
that you wear?

517
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:34,796
Right. Exactly!

518
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:42,318
- What did you do?
- I modified it. It will be my stage-costume...

519
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:44,602
Oh, no! What did you do?

520
00:42:48,007 --> 00:43:00,203
Ferhat, how are you looking?

521
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:02,086
What is the matter?

522
00:43:03,287 --> 00:43:07,200
Seyfi, the studio is waiting for you.
Go! Hurry up!

523
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:11,199
The humorists to this side and the
singers to the other one.

524
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:15,721
Say: "My biography has begun very sad.

525
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:17,718
Everybody died already, when
I was still very little"

526
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:21,004
- Improvise something!
- And if it will come to light later?

527
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:23,317
Than you can say, that they have
died for you.

528
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:26,205
Don't forget, to bring the audience to
applause...

529
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:33,206
...move your head a little bit to the right at
the beginning of the song!

530
00:43:34,287 --> 00:43:39,725
- Go! - We come! Give him the stuff
afterward, when he goes.

531
00:43:39,807 --> 00:43:41,206
- What stuff?
- Not before the end of singing.

532
00:43:52,287 --> 00:43:55,199
You wait here and than you will
be called in series.

533
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:27,200
- She is really like an angel.
- Her name is Melek

534
00:44:27,687 --> 00:44:30,918
- That's not true!
- It is. You are in love, don't you?

535
00:44:31,007 --> 00:44:33,202
I am dying, man!

536
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:45,316
Look Ferhat, when the red light is burning...

537
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:48,717
...the camera will be pointed at you, okay?
- Regard my artists!

538
00:44:48,807 --> 00:44:52,595
Hello, make everything well. They are my
artists!

539
00:44:54,287 --> 00:44:57,324
Don't take me with you as if I were a
pimp.

540
00:44:57,407 --> 00:45:00,319
How often I did explain it to you?
My car was defect.

541
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:02,318
You didn't do me a pleasure. Besides we
haven't made an agreement,

542
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:05,001
that you would come to me in my home.

543
00:45:05,087 --> 00:45:08,204
But it has happened. So I can see,
where you are living.

544
00:45:09,087 --> 00:45:12,079
- Can I do something goods to you?
- What do you mean?

545
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,203
- Will I give you the telephone-number?
- Of whom?

546
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:19,605
Okay, let me do it!

547
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:40,400
I love fashion shows.

548
00:46:41,287 --> 00:46:43,596
The only thing, that I don't like, are the
clothes.

549
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,923
Underwear is not the worst thing.

550
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:51,601
- Nature would be better.
- Hayri?

551
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:55,077
- Yes, my dear? -Do you know, why she
has shot me in my foot?

552
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:56,680
I know, it handled of the prick-length.

553
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,997
- Ss!
- What? What did you say?

554
00:46:59,087 --> 00:47:01,999
- Why?
-20000 Hayri!

555
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:05,921
I want the boxes and the money.
To-morrow is deadline.

556
00:47:06,007 --> 00:47:10,080
You will be amazed, they will bring our new
boy now instead of...

557
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:12,323
...Tanju Gürsoy, isn't it, Orhan?
- Solo, solo!

558
00:47:12,407 --> 00:47:14,204
Money!

559
00:47:18,687 --> 00:47:24,319
Damned, in spite of my illness they brought
me to here! I am there!

560
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:25,317
Welcome.

561
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:28,319
Don't smile to me like a queen
of wines, my child.

562
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:32,195
Look, I have come to here in spite of illness
without bribery I will not act.

563
00:47:34,887 --> 00:47:36,320
Now we are sitting in the shit!

564
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:39,399
Sorry, we have to modify the broadcast.

565
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:41,318
Well, next time better!

566
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:47,198
- Oh, no!
- In this way it will not go. Go now!

567
00:47:50,007 --> 00:47:55,206
Welcome, dear spectators at the screen.

568
00:47:55,887 --> 00:48:05,205
You do know him from his pictures,
his songs,

569
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:12,399
his private style of life and his
terrific shows.

570
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:16,002
Bravo, thist time you have founf somebody,
who is really good.

571
00:48:16,087 --> 00:48:22,196
- I have notion of talents.
- For you: Tanju Gürsoy!

572
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:29,205
Your whole life is a lie!

573
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:38,317
So I came in spite ofillness.
I was longing for my fans.

574
00:48:38,407 --> 00:48:44,198
Welcome. Straight on:

575
00:48:45,287 --> 00:48:52,204
One is asking if there is silicon in this
terrific body?

576
00:48:55,287 --> 00:49:00,202
In my boby everything is natural. As I said
already:

577
00:49:01,287 --> 00:49:04,199
I am totally content about myself.

578
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:07,201
Isn't this answer worth for an applause?

579
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,401
One knows her because of her famous days.

580
00:49:12,487 --> 00:49:18,198
But how were the years at the conservatory?

581
00:49:18,887 --> 00:49:22,004
Surely, the voice has become
a little bit worse.

582
00:49:22,287 --> 00:49:26,200
Education is very important.
I have learned at two universities.

583
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:33,320
I studied at the medical faculty of Çapa.
Neuro-psychology.

584
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:36,319
After some years at the university I was
snared by my passion for music.

585
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:38,477
We have had good, important teachers.

586
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:45,086
We were taught loving, important...

587
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:48,398
...pots boiling with love and passion.

588
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:51,718
My teacher brought me into a concert.

589
00:49:51,807 --> 00:49:58,599
After some vocal problems of the soloist
he threw me on the stage!

590
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:08,203
What is this?

591
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:14,597
Is it a joke?

592
00:50:18,687 --> 00:50:22,202
Do you see it!

593
00:50:26,287 --> 00:50:29,324
My artist is at T.V.!

594
00:50:29,407 --> 00:50:31,204
He is the coming star on the market.

595
00:50:35,287 --> 00:50:38,199
- My name is Ferhat.
- Very fine.

596
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:43,203
- My family-name is Can.
- What did he say?

597
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:45,996
He still didn't say anything!

598
00:50:46,087 --> 00:50:50,319
We have made an album for Umut Müzik
with friends.

599
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:52,796
He said Umut Müzik!

600
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:00,196
The album is called "Flowerfields".

601
00:51:03,087 --> 00:51:07,205
What happened? The current!

602
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:10,317
He did want to thank you at this way:

603
00:51:10,407 --> 00:51:13,319
"We are editing the box thanks Ýbrahim"

604
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:14,999
Bring the generator!

605
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:21,319
If you ask me now, what music means, so...

606
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:28,199
Let us ask, otherwise he will die by
excitement.

607
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:37,599
Well, music means to me a beautiful woman,

608
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:43,199
as beautiful as you.

609
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:52,204
I go to bed with her and wake up with her.

610
00:51:53,287 --> 00:51:57,200
I wish you a good broadcast. What is this,
where is Art staying?

611
00:51:57,687 --> 00:52:00,326
That is more like a erotic broadcast. Say,
there is a woman in me.

612
00:52:00,407 --> 00:52:07,199
Ask and give the answer yourself. What am I
seeking here?

613
00:52:10,287 --> 00:52:12,801
That's Tanju Gürsoy!
You never know, how you are.

614
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:18,202
But if you would ask me, what Art is...

615
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:30,076
Do you ask me, what Art is?

616
00:52:30,287 --> 00:52:35,202
Is there a generator?

617
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:40,405
In my opinion Art is a deal with the
spectator.

618
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:43,399
Properly all spectators are like one person.

619
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:46,047
You force them to listen and imagine,

620
00:52:46,127 --> 00:52:51,201
that one of them at the screen is
recording you.

621
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:55,198
That is trade!

622
00:53:00,687 --> 00:53:02,723
Now I have got the idea,

623
00:53:02,807 --> 00:53:06,322
that I want to remember me to Ibrahim,

624
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:09,205
who truly accompanied me on these journey.

625
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:13,316
We thank you for this interesting
conversation and

626
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:16,319
continue our broadcast according
to the program.

627
00:53:16,407 --> 00:53:19,604
There is a pause for advertising, but first...

628
00:53:19,687 --> 00:53:29,198
# I was naiv and had been deceived
by the colour of the world

629
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:39,002
# I trusted a dream and was
despaired in vain

630
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:50,195
# I believed you would be mine for all times

631
00:53:52,287 --> 00:54:00,604
# I am dying, beloved, and
you are my poison

632
00:54:02,687 --> 00:54:10,605
# You were the first man in my life:
now you are the last

633
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:18,205
A generator, man! I give the Umut
music empire for a generator!

634
00:54:21,287 --> 00:54:29,604
# I am a poor maiden, didn't do any
evil in this world

635
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:40,199
# I have established me in your
neighbourhood

636
00:54:42,887 --> 00:54:50,202
# I never have confessed my love to
somebody

637
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:55,200
You are there still. What a scandal!
My poor heart!

638
00:54:55,687 --> 00:54:57,598
Three minutes pause for advertising.

639
00:54:59,287 --> 00:55:01,198
We are in advertising, 3.40.

640
00:55:17,287 --> 00:55:26,195
# You are my centre and my cover

641
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:36,205
# My past and my last

642
00:55:44,687 --> 00:55:47,406
Didn't we want to strike like that fish!

643
00:55:47,487 --> 00:55:49,921
If there comes a storm, the fishes
will strike us.

644
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:52,316
Oh, if we could die now! We would be
free of this damned world!

645
00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:54,204
Why don't you open it?

646
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:56,200
What do you make there?

647
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:01,200
- Here, the suicide-letter.
- Do you write often?

648
00:56:01,687 --> 00:56:03,598
When inspiration comes,
sometimes.

649
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:06,198
- Read it to me!
- No, no! It is to absurd.

650
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:08,996
Well, read it!

651
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:17,202
- This is the suicide-letter of an
still existing Ferhat. -Go on!

652
00:56:21,287 --> 00:56:25,200
Nobody is responsiblefor my death,
Ferhat Can.

653
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:30,199
- Hayri!
- This is not a despairing act.

654
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:34,316
- Really not? - Never before in my life
I felt so courageous.

655
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:36,796
I was in love with songs

656
00:56:36,887 --> 00:56:40,197
I hope my tape will be published.

657
00:56:40,687 --> 00:56:42,803
And my lifeless voice will be at stores.

658
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:46,204
This is my wish from Umut Music.

659
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:48,798
My soul will be with you.

660
00:56:48,887 --> 00:56:52,596
Goodbye cruel world.

661
00:56:53,087 --> 00:56:57,205
Goodbye.

662
00:57:13,087 --> 00:57:16,204
Umut Müzik means everything for us.

663
00:57:22,287 --> 00:57:26,200
Tomorrow it will be on all front pages.

664
00:57:26,887 --> 00:57:29,196
All people will be baffled.

665
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:34,199
The letter is a poem. If this box will not be
sold like warm rolls, I let cut...

666
00:57:34,887 --> 00:57:37,196
...my prick and become Hayriye.

667
00:57:38,687 --> 00:57:41,201
Ferhat Can, represented by
Umut Music, stops with...

668
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:46,200
...the stolen car on the Bosporus bridge.
When he is holding his poetic...

669
00:57:46,687 --> 00:57:48,598
...last letter in his hands, the camera
glides down very slowly...

670
00:57:48,687 --> 00:57:51,599
...and falls. In this moment your song
begins, okay? -Everything is clear.

671
00:57:52,287 --> 00:57:54,039
Some more effects...

672
00:57:54,127 --> 00:57:58,200
...tears, a sincere, but bitter
smile on his face.

673
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:00,598
Than we will have succeeded.

674
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:04,396
- Who is playing too?
- Principe: best friend. Melih,...

675
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:08,196
You could play his role. Cry! Don't cry too
modestly.

676
00:58:08,887 --> 00:58:13,403
You will return three months later. "Ferhat
Can, the box of Abi's ghost. "

677
00:58:13,487 --> 00:58:16,206
Geistes Abi" It will be a big seller.

678
00:58:16,687 --> 00:58:21,203
Thereafter we will celebrate in Russia.

679
00:58:23,287 --> 00:58:26,404
- Did you sign the letter?
- What now?

680
00:58:26,487 --> 00:58:29,001
The reader has to know, that it was you,
who had died.

681
00:58:29,087 --> 00:58:30,998
I wrote it at the head of the letter.

682
00:58:34,287 --> 00:58:38,326
There it is. It has be signed also. Even the
stamp of Umut Music has been given.

683
00:58:38,407 --> 00:58:39,806
Bravo, well thought.

684
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,204
That is the wrong car! The letter ought
to be in the other car!

685
00:59:01,687 --> 00:59:03,882
# Turkey Turkey you're a lovely country

686
00:59:03,967 --> 00:59:06,322
# Turkey Turkey you're a cozy land.

687
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,918
# You're the land of chiskebab and raki

688
00:59:09,009 --> 00:59:11,284
# You're the place of living I have planed

689
00:59:11,369 --> 00:59:13,724
# Places full of very friendly people

690
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:16,198
# Always trying to help you if they can

691
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:18,519
# Turkey Turkey Turkey I adore you

692
00:59:18,609 --> 00:59:21,407
# Turkey Turkey Turkey I love you

693
00:59:43,089 --> 00:59:44,408
Ýbrahim? Hayri.

694
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:47,801
Let's make it short.
We were not able to organise money.

695
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:52,607
We are in the mud. We can't move us
above zero.

696
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,601
Two posters for 88000 $ 2 and one DAT.

697
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:58,404
Wonderful.

698
00:59:59,489 --> 01:00:01,400
You want to cut out us?

699
01:00:02,489 --> 01:00:04,798
What's on the box, that I could share?

700
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:07,400
If there is no other way to reach your mind:

701
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:15,520
we will send the bill and get the
money one day later.

702
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:17,804
There is no other way!

703
01:00:30,489 --> 01:00:32,798
- Hello, Kaveci.
- How are you, daddy?

704
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:36,406
My foot?
Well, it sends you his greetings.

705
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:40,599
I did mind the bones. Good recovery!

706
01:00:40,689 --> 01:00:42,998
Excuse for the circumstances. We are
mediators.

707
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:48,002
Of course, whatever you want.

708
01:01:24,489 --> 01:01:27,401
Is it the bill, Hayri?

709
01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:38,406
Enough! We don't chop off!

710
01:01:54,489 --> 01:01:57,401
What does this mean?

711
01:01:58,489 --> 01:02:02,402
We have to take the problem at the roots.

712
01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:06,205
- Umut Music?
- Upstairs.

713
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:09,406
All people have their story. This one
will be our story.

714
01:02:11,209 --> 01:02:12,403
Hello?

715
01:02:15,489 --> 01:02:19,004
- Don't make humbug. Don't cause costs,
Hayri. - Say goodbye to my children.

716
01:02:24,289 --> 01:02:27,406
- Umut Music, right?
- Yes?

717
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:31,401
I would like to buy a box
of Ferhat Can.

718
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:35,401
- In the moment we have no more boxes.
- And he?

719
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:38,598
- Who?
- Ferhat Can?

720
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:40,202
We don't have him either.

721
01:02:41,489 --> 01:02:43,525
Probably he is walking
around a little.

722
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:46,407
- I hope, I didn't disturb your work.
- Not at all!

723
01:02:51,489 --> 01:02:55,607
Go on, dear sirs, didn't you see something
like that never before?

724
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:59,204
We all are artists.
Kahtalý? Don't call the police!

725
01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:04,522
It was the wrong shop. They thought,
it was Osman's one

726
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:06,281
and shot it.

727
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:12,605
- Go, go! - Where do you stay?
This lady is waiting for you.

728
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:14,281
He was in the hotel.

729
01:03:16,689 --> 01:03:19,522
- Hello. I am Firuze.
- And I Ferhat.

730
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:22,123
Excuse me, there was a little accident.

731
01:03:22,209 --> 01:03:24,598
Fortunately you haven't been injured.

732
01:03:24,689 --> 01:03:27,999
Such a jewel as you are!
One should preserve you in worthy safes.

733
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:35,401
You have called me and I have come.

734
01:03:36,489 --> 01:03:39,401
I am this person, who is pursuing you with
attentiveness.

735
01:03:42,089 --> 01:03:44,523
I would like to have your box.

736
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:47,407
As you said: the selling has begin.

737
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:50,200
Are there boxes?

738
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:53,128
- Ferhat Bey, would you sing for me one
time more? - Of course.

739
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:56,918
What was it? " Come back "
is a beautiful song.

740
01:03:57,009 --> 01:03:59,807
- Flowerfields.
- Really a beautiful song.

741
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,798
- Ferhats box is not ready.
- We have a momentary financial problem.

742
01:04:08,089 --> 01:04:10,523
But mister Melih has beautiful boxes.

743
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:12,008
Thank you very much.

744
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:14,398
I would like to invest in you.

745
01:04:15,089 --> 01:04:16,807
What do you mean?

746
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:21,601
I am well to do. My husband and I were
long times active for Art,

747
01:04:21,689 --> 01:04:23,122
of course as dilettantes.

748
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:25,006
- Wonderful.
- Music is very important to me.

749
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:28,401
- And to your husband?
I lost him three years ago. Cancer.

750
01:04:28,889 --> 01:04:30,402
My condolence...

751
01:04:31,489 --> 01:04:33,400
What kind of cancer?

752
01:04:34,089 --> 01:04:38,207
Heart-cancer, that means money.

753
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:47,401
Children, go out a moment.
I want to have a talk with this lady.

754
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:50,605
I wish, that mister Ferhat Bey
stays, please.

755
01:04:50,689 --> 01:04:53,601
Of course he has to stay. I meaned...

756
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:57,398
There is no reason for secrets.

757
01:04:58,289 --> 01:05:02,407
Ask for tea, if you want.
Our most urgent problem.

758
01:05:02,889 --> 01:05:05,005
The financial problem can be solved easily.

759
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,400
Here is the bank.

760
01:05:12,889 --> 01:05:14,800
We call for the director.

761
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:17,802
Hello, mister Altan.

762
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:20,402
Thank you.

763
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:23,403
Please, open for me an account,
favouring Ferhat Can.

764
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:28,405
He will be disposable to you for
informations. Speak!

765
01:05:31,089 --> 01:05:31,919
Hello?

766
01:05:32,009 --> 01:05:34,523
- Mother's name?
- Sýdýka.

767
01:05:34,609 --> 01:05:36,520
- Father's name?
- Sinan.

768
01:05:36,609 --> 01:05:38,122
- Where's your born?
- Ankara.

769
01:05:38,209 --> 01:05:40,928
- Yours birth date?
- 76

770
01:05:41,009 --> 01:05:43,398
Can I speak Miss Sýdýka again?
Thank you.

771
01:05:43,889 --> 01:05:46,403
I want, that you will look very distinguished.

772
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:48,408
Hello Vakko?

773
01:05:48,889 --> 01:05:50,402
Please write down his name:
Ferhat Can!

774
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:53,403
He comes to you for shopping.

775
01:05:54,489 --> 01:05:57,401
Put everything on my meine account.
Thanks.

776
01:05:58,489 --> 01:06:02,801
- Besides it looks untidily here. You have to
do something. -That is condition.

777
01:06:03,489 --> 01:06:05,400
If you will make me happy, I will revenge me.

778
01:06:05,889 --> 01:06:09,006
Do, what I say. The rest comes alone.

779
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:11,523
Main point you believe. See you soon!

780
01:06:11,609 --> 01:06:14,123
Next time Secen will come with me.
She is able to give tips to you.

781
01:06:14,209 --> 01:06:17,406
- Sezen?
- Sezen Aksu.

782
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:20,605
She was a narrow friend of my late husband.

783
01:06:21,089 --> 01:06:25,401
- Once she composed a song for me.
- FÝRUZEE!...

784
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,515
Yes, I was very popular.

785
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,509
Well, it was a pleasure to me, mister Ferhat.

786
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,636
- So to us, at any case.
- Ferhat will accompany you until your car!

787
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,517
Of course.

788
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,514
Don't forget: The beginning is the half
business.

789
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,713
The end is the other half.

790
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,516
If you want to kill yourself, do it by living.

791
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:27,516
- And where do you live?
- In an hotel, in cartoon.

792
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,117
Hotel Cartoon? Understand.

793
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,512
Hotels
ever give a bad feeling.

794
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,639
The sorrows and pains of the guests use
to remain in the rooms.

795
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,508
- Rent a house.
- Okay.

796
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,516
On the backside of the mosque you will find
"Home Immoveables".

797
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,115
Remember me to mister Sadettin. He will
take sorrow for the house.

798
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,512
- Thank you very much, why do you do that?
- What?

799
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,512
Why do you help us?

800
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,511
You has called me and I have come.

801
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,716
You will get a cold in this weather.

802
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,918
- That's not important. -I have sent
away my driver. I will take a taxi.

803
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,515
I will call for a taxi.

804
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,512
Please wait. I will tell you something.

805
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,515
I didn't drive by bus since school-time.

806
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,912
You would take a city-bus?

807
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,999
Do you see, that you too have influence.

808
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,513
I have been changed by you.

809
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,716
Nevertheless you should not claim
this too much.

810
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,711
Please what?

811
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,109
The human being doesn't register
his own life.

812
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,512
He has to learn, how to live. See you soon.

813
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,919
Hello.

814
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,636
What are you doing. Bring the things
downstairs!

815
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,918
We have counted the days also.
We will pay you cash...

816
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,718
I don't want it!

817
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,634
This debt-story has no end.

818
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,631
We will edit your box also.

819
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,518
- Which box?
- That one with the prayers.

820
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:37,515
The angels came down from heaven, so
pure.

821
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,639
- No prayer for the soul. Hymns with
prayers!- That is also beautiful.

822
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,631
I get goose-flesh, Hayri.

823
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,632
Cut off! You are producing boxes
for bitches in order to...

824
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,712
...mix them with my prayer-hymns.
I don't want a box!

825
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,633
We of Umut Music will renew the
structures of our company.

826
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,632
If we bring out your prayer-hymns...

827
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,518
...with clarinets and percussion,
there will be created...

828
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,316
...an incredible sound.

829
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,118
We will make a contract for five years.

830
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,111
Three years are gratis and we will
take over all extras.

831
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,519
That will become a new trend.

832
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,513
What means "Trend"?

833
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,633
"Trend" is the name of the mosque
that is built in Taksim.

834
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,518
- I didn't hear anything about it.
- Neither did I. Come uncle!

835
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,113
Come you!

836
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:22,514
The angels are descending
gullibly from heaven!

837
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,513
Making a chants tape for so cheap?
God will curse us.

838
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,511
Sibel, there has been a woman here.

839
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,389
I believe, she wants to invest in our
company.

840
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,517
Will we wait a little until we
will drive home? Butler!

841
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,511
The wedding will be delayed.

842
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,633
It doesn't matter. We can wait...

843
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,518
We have to decide right now.

844
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,516
I am pregnant.

845
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,512
# I woke up without you this morning

846
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:12,513
# It doesn't work without you

847
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,515
# Even my first cigarette did not taste well

848
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,509
# It doesn't work without you

849
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,515
# Love is zero-balance

850
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,910
# It doesn't work without you

851
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,512
# A love, that got balance

852
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,517
# It doesn't work without you

853
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,513
# I had to ask me again

854
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,513
- # Why do I want you so much?
- I love you.

855
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:58,516
# Come, my angel, let me love your nice
face also

856
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,318
Silence!

857
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,513
What did he do evil to this poor girl!

858
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,515
Look at her, how miserable!

859
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,512
Son of a bitch!

860
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,511
I call you in order to wish you good
recovery.

861
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,511
If that swine touches you again,

862
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,038
I will kill him!

863
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,510
His own mother will not recognise him.
Hello?

864
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,230
Thank you very much.

865
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,034
Look, the beauty of our shop is
coming again, Hayri.

866
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:32,511
How beautiful. Like a jewel, like flowers!

867
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,395
- Hello!
- Hello brother.

868
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,273
Where is the fairy queen?

869
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,309
Friends, for the hail of our land, our nation
we even owe money to the painters.

870
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,517
That all happens, because money is
coming in. We have to find her.

871
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,512
Hello. Miss Firuze!

872
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,512
Here is Orhan.
We just have spoken of you.

873
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,911
All ready. The shop, we also are shining.

874
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,511
Please, one minute.
I will fetch Ferhat. For you!

875
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,513
Where? Grand Cevahir, what time?

876
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,513
Of course. The song..,

877
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,318
Thank you very much.

878
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,313
We will see each other.

879
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,717
- Did she make available money?
- That she didn't say.

880
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,394
She only told something about heritage
complications.

881
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,630
Oh no! Delay until tomorrow
would be deadly.

882
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,517
No, we have to maintain. Main point
the box will be edited.

883
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,515
Oh no, we can't enter the hotel in these
clothes.

884
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,310
Let us buy some clothes at Vakko.

885
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,709
Wait, not too fast. That is not suitable to us!

886
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,392
We don't want to blame our name.

887
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,074
The Turkish people are living for
honour and fame.

888
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,388
We will find something suitable.

889
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,034
By your love I have come into this
miserable situation.

890
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,918
I possessed everything except you.

891
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,520
# By your love I have come into this
miserable situation

892
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:59,118
# I possessed everything except you

893
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,520
# I didn't fear rain and have gone my way

894
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,518
# I get goose-flesh by thinking, that you
maybe are not at home

895
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:22,914
# If we would make love, we would
drink until daylight

896
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:29,516
# I wouldn't go to my work and you
wouldn't go home

897
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:42,516
# I get goose-flesh:
what to do, if you will not be at home

898
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:03,515
Impossible, children!
I am always at home.

899
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,238
Let us come to the box.

900
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,919
We need good advertising.

901
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,718
Posters in all streets. The newspaper
get a whole page with advertising.

902
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,119
We could shoot a clip also, couldn't we?

903
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,713
Why not black-white?

904
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,631
The pink at the suit is the first thing, that
gets a colour.

905
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,312
Because of the name "Flower-fields".

906
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,909
Children, make a budget for the open air
concertin the stadium.

907
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,515
Everything at summer. The concerts in
Aspendos are the most important events.

908
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,114
- That is true.
- An excellent idea.

909
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,309
Hopefully you don't think: "We have found
a rich chicken in order to pluck.

910
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,710
Oh no, how can you think this of us!

911
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,711
I have a good feeling for investments.

912
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,511
You have inspired me to the
enchanting formula,

913
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,673
that opens the gate of my country.

914
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,716
I have sought for it several years.

915
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,836
Never could I find the entrance.

916
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,512
What do you say?

917
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,916
You are looking upon a splendid future,

918
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,513
but you have to believe on it. Like I do.
- Right!

919
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,518
Friends, do you feel arising synergy,
when we are together?

920
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,513
Now close your eyes and take the
hands of your neighbours.

921
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,515
Do you feel the force?

922
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,113
I do in fact.

923
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,509
You see: that is it!

924
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,516
Yes, I feel different.

925
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,515
- That's it!
- Yes, it has happened.

926
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,319
This is always.

927
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,513
I believe, you have found a gold-mine
again, miss Firuze.

928
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,637
Now the work is following.

929
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,392
This gentleman is the owner.

930
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,711
- He is serving me personally, every time I
come- He is honour and pleasure to me.

931
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,519
- Hello.
- Mr Ferhat,

932
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,517
there are important things we have to
talk about. Afterwards?

933
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,512
Hello. I am a fan of yours, Angel.

934
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,514
You inspired me the charmed words to
open the gate to my real country

935
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,512
that I searched for years and couldn't
find the entrance to.

936
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,517
I discovered this code with you. If I
lose you, I'll forget it again.

937
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,516
I dreamt that you were a sweet little girl
a soft, mellow lover, a warm friend.

938
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,718
I am standing right besides you.

939
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,519
A man can only stand behind you.

940
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,395
Shadowed by you,

941
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,118
under your wide wings.

942
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,830
An invisible hand keeps me away.

943
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,514
The man you desire does not know
how this feels like.

944
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,831
May I be that man?

945
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,637
- Kürþat give me that!
- You are hiding a thing.

946
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,359
I am not hiding anything!
Give me that please!

947
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,510
What did you do?

948
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,512
Maybe all I wanted was

949
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,516
to sing a song together.

950
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,672
An ordinary, cute song.

951
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,515
I wish you could hear it.

952
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,918
Where is Kürþat?

953
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,310
To hit a woman?

954
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,918
No! I didn't do anything.

955
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,514
I will beat the living daylights out of you!

956
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,515
Where is the prick of that dog?

957
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,511
Sell and give out the money!

958
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,639
Damned what will happen to us, you
bastard?

959
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,392
I swear you, I will take revenge.

960
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,233
My father is keeping me short.
He doesn't give me money any more.

961
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,389
We will cut you

962
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,516
into little slices.

963
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,111
Your eyes you son of a bitch,

964
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,919
superb ass-hole!

965
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,912
You will always remember this view.

966
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,115
You have to pay the saxophone-player
and our share on what has been sold

967
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,713
right now-!

968
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,717
I am here in order to protect you.
In order to save your life,

969
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,711
respecting your father.

970
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,313
You are here in Turkey.

971
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,712
If you park your car you have to pay

972
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,518
in order to prevent damages to your car.

973
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,909
Tayyar has to give you some money.

974
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,231
We marry you off!

975
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,517
Than it will be okay, otherwise!

976
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,514
You get addicted in this way!

977
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,513
A practical joke! You are to much fan of the
Americans!

978
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,513
Help me!

979
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,516
- Have you seen it?
- What than?

980
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,515
- Were not you there?
- No, I haven't seen anything.

981
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,516
Please select for me, I have to call that girl!

982
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,515
Hello sweetheart, It's me.

983
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,717
Are you at home? I will come
and call for you.

984
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,511
A concert in Aspendos.

985
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,716
I have enough of the popular press.

986
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,509
There is no more privacy! I want to alter just
this,do you understand?

987
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,637
I want to share my life and these endless
disruptions only with you.

988
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,915
I love you!

989
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,512
Melek, marry me!

990
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,239
Why do we stop?

991
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,512
I believe, that's your house.

992
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:28,515
- One moment, Ibrahim, what's the matter?
- Hayri, Hayri!

993
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:34,628
- That's our justice.
- Take it easy, time is over.

994
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:38,508
Do you understand?

995
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:43,109
The weather is beautiful, the field free.

996
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,511
The better one should win!

997
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,515
Nevertheless you have to suffer a little bit!

998
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,709
- For gods sake!
- Come, fair play, fair play!

999
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:57,918
- We have a partner, a sponsor, control it!
- Money is no problem.

1000
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,036
Your investor is this harmless Ferhat?

1001
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,509
- Are you responsible for the money?
- Please?

1002
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,516
- Six millions please.
- What do you mean?

1003
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,518
Money for two three-million-bullets.

1004
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,513
- We haven't that much!
- Give him all, what we have!

1005
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,709
- We have three million.
- Make your heels free.

1006
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,509
- Please wait still! Oh god!
- Let me speak please!

1007
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,389
Hello!

1008
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,639
This is our partner and sponsor,
our soul and everything.

1009
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,915
How are you?

1010
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,639
These bandits assert, that you are their
partner. I don't believe them, but...

1011
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:49,033
- It is true. - We have a little problem, that
we probably will solve with you.

1012
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,519
Which bank?

1013
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,639
The cash-pay-record-shop,
if you want an other bank...

1014
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:57,508
- Your money will be there tomorrow.
How much? - 88000 in $!

1015
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,719
That's too much, what do you think,
mister Orhan?

1016
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,713
I am your opinion, but mister Ýbrahim has a
different vision.

1017
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,917
- One half cash, the other one in rates.
- That's convenient!

1018
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,512
Tomorrow, but you will be dead,

1019
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:16,512
if there is any delay, for what reason ever!

1020
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,515
Please, that doesn't go!

1021
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,318
- At ten o'clock.
- Ten!

1022
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,710
Please close the door behind you.

1023
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,914
- We will see tomorrow.
- If you permit.

1024
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,392
- Come now!
- There is nothing wrong?

1025
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,916
Are you joking?
Please give me my three millions.

1026
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,511
Thank you!

1027
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,830
Orhan, take it please! Okay,
now we will go also.

1028
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,912
- Let us tidy up the papers.
- Okay, later, so I say bye-bye.

1029
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,913
- Ferhat? Are you well?
- Yes and you?

1030
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,511
Riddle please, why I have come.

1031
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:08,716
- I believe to know it.
- Who is that?

1032
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,510
- A poster, only for decoration.
- Did you expect me?

1033
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,517
Yes, I did.

1034
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,515
Is this your bed?

1035
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,116
- Yes, if you sit down...
- Am I allowed to sit down?

1036
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,519
Of course.

1037
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,519
Come,

1038
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,709
I have to say you something but how?

1039
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:57,517
Sometimes there are feelings for
somebody at once...

1040
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:04,516
...you know, for somebody, who is totally
foreign. It simply comes.

1041
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,511
Yes, I understand.

1042
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,513
Properly one should say it open-minded,
but it is...

1043
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,910
difficult to find the right words.
- I agree with you.

1044
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,511
You...

1045
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,512
You are a beautiful man.

1046
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:38,518
- No, that is only your...
- Wonderful! Great!

1047
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:43,313
- You are great also.
- You are like a star.

1048
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,115
- Your behaviour should be star-like also!
- All right.

1049
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,509
- Do trust yourself.
- All right, all right.

1050
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,914
You don't think, that I am trying to take profit
of this situation, do you?

1051
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,511
It is good to be open-minded.

1052
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,914
Properly I know very well, what you are
suffering.

1053
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,717
Let us not play together. I am so confused to
make it short:

1054
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,518
it has no sense.

1055
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,116
Ferhat,

1056
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:25,515
I know you have fallen in love with me
totally!

1057
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:44,508
# Fifty stars are shining in heaven.
You can see them clearly

1058
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,120
# Eyes are treating furtive love

1059
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,513
# You can read unspoken love in the eyes

1060
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:07,518
# A loving bird doesn't know food and water

1061
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:17,515
# Could I come together with my
beloved one time a year?

1062
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,512
There is ever no trace of your partner.

1063
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,516
What's your
comment upon it?

1064
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,116
What do you tell me there?

1065
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,509
I have said, I can't take profit of the
situation. That's what she has said.

1066
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,709
What does it mean? Couldn't he say:
come and take profit of me'?

1067
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:52,512
No, Tayyar, his boy has received two slaps.
He is crying right at the moment.

1068
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:57,108
- Dear Ibrahim.
- What do you say? What?

1069
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:01,512
That lady has opened an account.

1070
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:09,310
Of course she has paid on this account.
What else?

1071
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,636
- Push play, you bastard!
- Dear Ýbrahim!

1072
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:15,633
Let us fix the money. Thereafter we will
speak with Tayyar.

1073
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,518
We will have an orgy of circumcision or
something like it. Doubtless you will make it.

1074
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,637
Okay, you still have one hour.

1075
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:28,317
If it goes wrong, you know what is
waiting for you!

1076
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:33,628
We will be there soon with the
money-bundles. In which way we will bear them?

1077
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,518
It's the wrong time for jokes!

1078
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,511
I would like to withdraw money.

1079
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,513
Of course, but there is no account
on your name.

1080
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,518
Really? Can I speak with the
directress please?

1081
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,511
We have a director.

1082
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,511
Is this the wrong address?

1083
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,637
Miss Firuze? We don't have this client.

1084
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:12,508
I can't remember, we have had her
in former days.

1085
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,513
# You are like black ribbon, Firuze

1086
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,512
# In your eyes there is haste

1087
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,516
# The years are too slow for you

1088
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:39,509
# Why are you in hurry? Wait

1089
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,909
If your wheel don't have gaps, you are
a newcomer in this profession.

1090
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,397
Tayyar!

1091
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,517
How did you discover it?

1092
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,515
We will take Tayyar Baba into our club.
Come, my dear, come!

1093
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:15,710
I ask you for advice.
Do you permit?

1094
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,916
- Do come into the basin!
- I come.

1095
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,716
Are you able to swim?

1096
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:33,634
Are you joking? I have grown up at the
beach of the Black Sea.

1097
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,517
We are like this fish.
We have come in order to attack.

1098
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:43,628
- Where are the life-belts?
- We have no more of them!

1099
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,711
Now. Come to me!

1100
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,037
- Orhan, Who was this?
- Whom do you mean?

1101
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:15,317
- That one, who just past before?
- Tayyar's son.

1102
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,517
- What do you say?
- Daddy, the invitations will come today.

1103
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:26,628
- You could drown.
- I have a boy with a terrific voice.

1104
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:29,632
Could you give us an extra.
For example an...

1105
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:33,508
...a party of circumcision or something
like it. -I'll pay the singers.

1106
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,709
I found this boy from Germany. You have
token him.

1107
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:43,512
Your Melih took my singer, seduced her and
fathered a child with her. Fuck!

1108
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,636
Hayri! I come!

1109
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:52,508
- He is drowning!
- Good heaven!

1110
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,512
Orhan, look at him!

1111
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:14,118
Everybody is praising your voice.
Let hear it!

1112
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,510
- I have saved you, Hayri!
- So sing!

1113
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,516
Sing nightingale, sing!

1114
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:26,515
# Your heaven were blue, so blue

1115
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:34,516
# The clouds were silver, your hair was
white

1116
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,639
# There is a rain, so sad and gloomy

1117
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:51,517
# When you laugh, tears should flow upon
my hands

1118
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:59,516
# A woman, white, quiet and enchanting

1119
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:07,516
# A woman, wet, fine and warm

1120
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,518
# She has to be sorceress of the songs

1121
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,513
- Will you marry? - He asked my hand right
at the moment, I wanted to leave him.

1122
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,511
He says, that he loves me.

1123
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:28,512
Forget this person finally!
Advertising, a role in a movie...

1124
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,636
You could earn a lot of money.

1125
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,631
The Turkish cinema has future.

1126
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:36,518
Acting is worse than living with Kürþat!

1127
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,116
I hardly can wear the hungry eyes of the
spectators.

1128
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:44,310
I cannot endure fashion-shows,
the stage, the camera's!

1129
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,518
All are looking at me unbrokenly, no!

1130
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,513
Who is there?

1131
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:06,518
I know: the person, who has
written the letter.

1132
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:12,518
I haven't read the rest, but it was very fine.

1133
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,909
Are you still there?

1134
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,511
Please speak!

1135
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,515
Properly I would like to get to know you.

1136
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,117
What did he say?
How does he know it?

1137
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,509
Except Melih the whole world
will know it already.

1138
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,515
Sweetheart, if we could regulate your
blood-pressure in some way!

1139
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,511
I never sang pop before, but you know,
I am apt to do it.

1140
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,516
Could you talk about it once more?

1141
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:57,512
Where is the serum?

1142
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,914
Hayri will get work of Tayyar, isn't it?

1143
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,909
We will get money.
The medicine is sure.

1144
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:07,512
Even with the medicine it will be very
difficult, Seyfi.

1145
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,236
Don't you know it? Don't you know the
serious condition of the patient?

1146
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:15,518
- You want the baby unconditionally?
- There is nothing, what I could do.

1147
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,915
Go out, friends! Don't stress the girl without
necessity.

1148
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:28,518
Next week we will shoot Ferhat's clip.
Who is the director?

1149
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,716
- You!
- My love,

1150
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:36,510
if you would be a little healthier, you
could come to the set with me.

1151
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,918
Everything is black and

1152
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:45,713
white until an angel arrives, who brings
a baby with wings.

1153
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,516
When the baby comes, the clip will
get colours.

1154
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,511
It is dedicated to you.

1155
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,516
Sezen Aksu is seeking a soprano.

1156
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,511
# Let me pass

1157
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,515
# My pot has been filled by gifts

1158
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,718
# I know neither sins nor damage

1159
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,519
# I am burning of pain

1160
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,516
# So I have got the pain

1161
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:29,520
# What a strange way

1162
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:34,518
# Sometimes I lost him, other times
I found him again

1163
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,515
# I wobbled and didn't move
any more. Let me pass

1164
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,511
# Give me my head

1165
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,719
# I can't sacrifice myself

1166
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,314
# I can't loose myself, can't separate
me of myself

1167
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:54,517
It is the second time, that a haven't got
shampoo in my eyes.

1168
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,912
- It will not work.
- I already said, I don't leave my artists.

1169
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,710
I have been angry with you,
but next time I will bring you out.

1170
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,836
Don't worry about it!

1171
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,717
Main point we got the party.

1172
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:09,031
The rest will be easy!
The only thing is, that...

1173
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:11,031
We have to organise the fare still.
That is easy.

1174
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:13,270
But Ferhat needs a stage-costume.

1175
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:19,708
# Renew my fate, Kahtalým. Do create me
one time more

1176
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,836
You king of all barbers. Good morning.
How are you?

1177
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:26,512
Also, I am very happy,
I started a new diet and work on a new box.

1178
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,629
The whole country will speak about it.
Now I am coming out! I am coming!

1179
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:34,508
Come here. Didn't you have a suit for us,
did you? Come!

1180
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,831
- Please, stand besides him!
- Why?

1181
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,514
It will be a little too wide, but it is
the same size.

1182
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,914
Don't mind. Wide will be in the
fashion this year.

1183
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,709
Heaven, don't talk such humbug!

1184
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,030
- Besides: to where do you want to go?
- To my village.

1185
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,031
No, never. You have a contract!

1186
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,634
But Hayri Abi didn't want me
at all. Neither did miss Sansar.

1187
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,631
Accordingly I am displaced here.

1188
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,518
I have your rights on the box. Look
what has been written!

1189
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:05,518
It is valid in the whole galaxy
do you understand, sweety?

1190
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,511
Fucked nightingale!

1191
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:16,309
But where is the music?
We have fixed everything except the music!

1192
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:17,510
Music is everywhere, man!

1193
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:21,913
In the bus, in the streets, in the heads
of the people,

1194
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:28,509
in shops, restaurants, at brokers,
everywhere!

1195
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,316
Music is eaten and drunk during
footballgames and elections.

1196
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:36,520
One is cursing with music and in this
country no love is swore without music!

1197
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,509
- Please drive to the right side. I want
to bale out. - To where?

1198
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,231
I have forgotten something in the
hotel. I will return immediately.

1199
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,231
Don't come too late, otherwise I will
loose my temper!

1200
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,515
All right, I will be there!

1201
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,717
- Come soon, okay?
- You engage young talents?

1202
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,518
For the concert tonight.

1203
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,909
Am I allowed to recite, please?

1204
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,910
- He has to, Hayri?
- Do sing, I have said already!

1205
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,517
# Does love forgive everything thanks
former happy days?

1206
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:10,517
# Does time make forget?

1207
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:31,709
- Do you know miss Firuze?
- Yes. She is living in this palace.

1208
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:36,912
- She was seeking a room for a girlfriend.
- Where,which palace?

1209
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,512
- Miss Firuze! I did seek you everywhere...
- Excuse me!

1210
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,915
I beg you pardon, I mixed up you with
miss Firuze.

1211
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,512
So the broker and your dress...

1212
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:07,513
Please, let us go in.

1213
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,319
Excuse me please. I just came from Cyprus.

1214
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:18,913
- How do you know miss Firuze?
- She is our producer.

1215
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,511
What does she produce?

1216
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:25,915
We make music and give concerts.

1217
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:29,114
So she has changed her profession?

1218
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:58,714
Whom do I see there? Welcome.

1219
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,318
Welcome.

1220
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,831
Please, miss Firuze, take it easy!

1221
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,511
Could I speak with you outside?

1222
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,630
I don't understand, why my clothes?

1223
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:24,234
She was healing already.
But than the illness took another way.

1224
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,029
- I did not registry it. It went too fast.
- We have to drive away this group!

1225
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:30,395
Sorry, but what is the matter with her?

1226
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,708
Miss Firuze has seen you at T.V.

1227
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,109
She has thought, you had been fallen in
love with her.

1228
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,509
The brain is an enigma.

1229
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:41,513
- What does she have?
- Schizophrenia.

1230
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,391
What does this mean, schizophrenia?

1231
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:47,517
If you are speaking with god, they call it
prayer.

1232
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:52,518
If god is speaking to you,
they call it schizophrenia.

1233
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,512
If my colleges could hear this!

1234
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:01,715
- And the other people? -They are my other
patients therapy for groups!

1235
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,391
So she doesn't have money?

1236
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,630
Sir, Firuze has been born in this palace.
She has grown up here.

1237
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,392
But how do I have to say?

1238
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,516
Their parents were assisting miss Süreyya's.

1239
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,717
- So this place?
- This is her house.

1240
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,110
She has established the company of
schizophrenia.

1241
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:24,715
- I understand.
- Hello, we telephoned.

1242
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,519
It has been paid money on your off shore
account.

1243
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,709
Mister Ferhat, it is a honour for us, to
receive artists like you in our bank.

1244
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,914
I have to bring Firuze back to her father.

1245
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:41,394
- Mister Ferhat!- If you permit, I would like
to speak with the gentleman.

1246
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:44,517
He has to be confronted with reality!

1247
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,509
Where is he?

1248
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,516
What did he say to him?

1249
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:22,915
- The truth.
- He has gone thereafter?

1250
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,511
What is reality?

1251
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,509
You have disappointed him.

1252
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:35,520
That was not our aim.
What does rest after saying the truth?

1253
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:39,512
If you are real, I am a lie.

1254
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,909
A paradise without angels!

1255
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:07,637
# The curse of the devil is in the songs

1256
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:10,518
# filled by enthousiasm my
situation is serious

1257
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:14,510
# This game is always bad. My dices
always are marked

1258
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,512
# It is the endless game, that is
played by fate

1259
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,511
# If the dices fall in this way

1260
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,911
# I use to love the beautiful but they
have to be young

1261
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,512
# The heart is incorrigible

1262
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,709
Look at Hoca and Tatu!

1263
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,712
They are having fun.

1264
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,633
Let them enjoy themselves.

1265
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,711
Why did you come here?

1266
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,711
What did you do?

1267
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,392
The ambience is very good. Will I let
dance Halay?

1268
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:45,513
No, wait! Delay what you can.
Go on until they become red.

1269
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,636
Ferhat, wo do you stay?

1270
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,915
- All are waiting for you!
- I am no more of the game.

1271
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:09,914
- What does this mean?
- I am not of the game.

1272
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,913
- Come and rise!
- No, let me. Why are you here?

1273
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,515
Because of this money. If I could
get some of it...

1274
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,718
I will buy a ticket to my country.

1275
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:25,519
This guy really does want to become slim.

1276
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,511
Look at this! All personalities

1277
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,309
of the world of records and newspapers
have come.

1278
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,392
- But where is this little bastard?
- Take it easy and sit down.

1279
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:41,109
This person always has depressions.
What for?

1280
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,509
As if his beloved has been fucked.
This damned, stupid german!

1281
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,716
- Go, Ferhat.
- Give up me, Melih!

1282
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,916
Why do you give up this dream?

1283
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,516
It is because a girl, isn't it?

1284
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,709
- Why not?
- I also am in love.

1285
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,916
Therefor I can't sing there now.

1286
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,516
- Who is she, man?
- Melek.

1287
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:03,511
Melek?

1288
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,511
It is her wedding.

1289
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:43,309
- How are you? -You are honouring us.
Thank you very much!

1290
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:57,512
Tayyar will kill us. Who is acting
in stead of Ferhat?

1291
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:05,513
No. Studio yes. I am no type for stage.

1292
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:16,309
Will we get off with the money?

1293
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:20,512
In taht case we are lost...
Who was it?

1294
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:24,319
Go well.

1295
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:28,632
There are no problems, are there?

1296
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:34,511
- No problems. Everything goes digitally!
- Flowers!

1297
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:40,518
- Look, what I have for you.
- What's that?

1298
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,310
My bill. Tayyar gave me the advance.

1299
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:47,517
You have to pay the musicians with the rest.

1300
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,515
You beggars.

1301
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:53,509
Tayyar will present you an account also.

1302
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,312
I didn't want to say it, but the musicians get
their money from another source.

1303
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:01,512
- That's not true!
- It is. I got the rest in cheque.

1304
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:08,316
- Tayyar does understand you.
- Where is the artist?

1305
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,919
Without money no artist.

1306
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,713
You have to know it.

1307
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:21,510
The son of the "heel-killer" wants to marry
and you leave the wedding-party.

1308
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:28,515
Gratulations, you have courage.

1309
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:36,312
- Do you pay at least value added tax?
- Don't worry, we will fix it.

1310
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:40,239
They shoot, if we stay.

1311
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,515
But also, if we try to flee.

1312
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,514
We have a umbrella inside.

1313
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,038
And they have opened it.

1314
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:49,917
The movie has ended. But they don't write
"end".

1315
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,710
You have to see it.

1316
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:57,837
- What is the matter?
- What kind of movie?

1317
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,514
Ýbrahim und Sansar put the money
in their pocket

1318
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:04,515
and didn't pay the orchestra. We are lost.

1319
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:19,508
It is all right! An entry at this wedding
wouldn't be suitable to you!

1320
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,716
It would not be suitable to you also.

1321
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,511
Fortunately we have no entry!

1322
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:32,718
- Do you know, why we are loosing?
- Why?

1323
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,519
Why we are capitulating always?

1324
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:41,520
Because we always, we always...

1325
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,911
- How?
- Why?

1326
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:47,512
- We are to honest!
- Humbug!

1327
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,113
Really.

1328
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:56,516
It is true.

1329
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,511
It is softening you up finally.

1330
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,509
- I have been softened up.
- Yes, it softens you up.

1331
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:11,510
You have to take it easy sometimes.

1332
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,511
Cheers? I would kill the person,

1333
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:19,512
who has served me this serum, in the
middle of Taksim-square.

1334
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:23,512
Stop it, Seyfi.

1335
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:26,512
He makes me furious!

1336
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,516
Melih,

1337
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:40,515
we should let it be.

1338
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,519
You are wright.

1339
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:52,520
If we are already on our way...

1340
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:02,515
- If we suicide...
- We do it living.

1341
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,511
# Forgive me

1342
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:50,517
# It is too early for loosing and too late for
loving

1343
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:53,909
# Forgive me

1344
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,397
Sir Tayyar

1345
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:01,314
Forbidden, I let if forbid in Turkeye and now
he is acting on my party!

1346
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:08,909
# At least your name should remain at the
end of broken things

1347
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:13,512
# Pursued by Lonelyness

1348
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:17,512
# Forgive me

1349
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:24,914
# At time of my love

1350
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:30,594
# There still has been rain in this city

1351
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:32,511
Kill the bastard!

1352
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,913
# Forgive me

1353
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:41,513
# It is too early for loosing

1354
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:45,512
# And too late for loving

1355
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:49,512
# Forgive me

1356
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:57,516
# At time of my love

1357
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:04,519
# There still has been rain in this city

1358
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,518
# At time of my love

1359
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:21,519
# Love was as heavy as led in this city

1360
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,514
# Forgive me

1361
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:27,511
# The poems of your eyes

1362
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,518
# The songs of your hair

1363
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:37,512
Did you really want to kill me or not?

1364
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,515
Death is the end of all suffering.
We are on earth in order

1365
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,514
to make suffering so that hell can be
unburdened.

1366
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,232
- Wag, you are really sensitive!
- Yes very.

1367
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:50,639
That is a part of my profession.

1368
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:53,393
Sometimes feelings are stronger than
reason.

1369
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:56,517
Let us make a box for you.
That was only a joke!

1370
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:00,512
Here a demo. Listen to it!

1371
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:05,834
- I will apply to you.
- Of course you will.

1372
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:08,309
- Certainly I will apply.
- So do it!

1373
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:12,632
- I did say it, haven't I?
- Yes, you will excuse me now.

1374
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:16,508
- What's the matter?
- We will throw out you immediately.

1375
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,038
That's how the profession is like.

1376
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:21,917
We will break one or two of your
bones also. By tradition.

1377
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,516
Do you prefer some of them?

1378
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:31,515
Properly we prefer an existing bone
Orhan, flee!

1379
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,516
What do you look? Get them!

1380
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:00,910
# There is no return. I have put fire
to all my ships

1381
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:04,517
# This masked ball with all these false

1382
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,913
# faces is unbearable to me

1383
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:17,712
One mosque is not enough to you, uncle?
Let us go.

1384
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:18,516
Let us save them.

1385
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:22,511
You believe, it is a fire?

1386
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:28,516
Is the basis ready?

1387
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,514
All ready, in remembrance to our
common nights.

1388
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:46,516
Wait! Firuze, where are you?

1389
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,512
Ferhat has found Firuze.

1390
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:22,637
Don't believe, that it is the end.

1391
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:25,234
The endless competition never will stop.

1392
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:27,515
They will weep a lot about us and they will
laugh.

1393
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,513
Now all together.

1394
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:38,518
# Starving melodies are snaring my heart

1395
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:47,509
# Such a dream, as there were merely songs

1396
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,515
# Flying birds seagulls

1397
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,514
# A sweet and green springtime

1398
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:33,515
# Laughing and merry love-pairs

1399
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:43,516
# Here were sorrows, there desires

1400
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:53,518
# Such a sea of loving waves

1401
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:32,114
I have token everything from hospital.

1402
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:35,318
I don't want to come with you now.

1403
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:36,719
Everybody should decide for himself.

1404
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:38,392
No, impossible.

1405
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:41,517
We have begun together
and we will end together.

1406
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:45,518
It is better, that he doesn't know, that he
has a poor father.

1407
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:47,913
It doesn't mind, that I will not be there.

1408
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:52,513
I am a burden.
He should throw me off.

1409
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:02,115
It is the end for me but I am sorry, that
I have put you with me.

1410
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:07,513
That's not necessary! Cheers!

1411
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:15,513
Now the end has come finally.

1412
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:21,516
Sorry, I haven't succeeded.

1413
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:45,516
Sorry, I have a gastric ulcer.

1414
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:49,511
They have gone!

1415
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:56,912
- Seyfi?
- Melih!

1416
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,513
Ferhat?

1417
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:02,511
- Ferhat, wake up, my boy.
- I beg you!

1418
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,911
We are loosing him! Run, keep water.

1419
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:09,511
Please, come!

1420
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:19,512
Ferhat, wake up.
Please, come!

1421
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:24,513
Ferhat, wake up.

1422
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:41,512
- You coward!
- Where is Firuze?

1423
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:46,513
We have been reborn.

1424
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:50,512
Friends, let us start at zero again.

1425
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,911
Nobody can halt us.

1426
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:57,513
We will found a new company with
a colourful name.

1427
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:02,513
The turn is on us, to serve electric shocks

1428
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:04,717
like the fish under the sand.

1429
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:07,958
What was his name?

1430
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:13,511
RA- RAY!

1431
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:17,716
To Hilmi Topaloglu.

1432
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:23,511
Scandal at the wedding!

1433
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,709
Their album has been sold 2 million copies.

1434
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:32,715
Turkey is talking about them.

1435
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:36,998
"I was a lighter, I became a director. Now it's
Hollywood!"

1436
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:42,712
We all owe it to Firuze.

1437
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:46,509
Melek broke up with her lover.

1438
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:55,512
Firuze still at large.
